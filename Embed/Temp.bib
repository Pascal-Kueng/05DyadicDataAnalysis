Participants were briefly exposed to behavioral information implying a specific goal and were then given the opportunity to act on the goal in a different way and context. Studies 1-3 established the goal contagion phenomenon by showing that the behavioral consequences of goal contagion possess features of goal directedness: (a) They are affected by goal strength, (b) they have the quality of goal appropriateness, and (c) they are characterized by persistence. Studies 4-6 show that people do not automatically adopt goals when the observed goal pursuit is conducted in an unacceptable manner, because the goal will then be perceived as unattractive. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on automatic goal pursuits. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and illness globally. There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between quitting rates and partners’ smoking status. It is thought that spouses influence one another’s health habits, including smoking. This study aims to evaluate this association in patients who made a smoking cessation attempt with pharmacotherapy. METHODS For this Israeli nationwide retrospective cohort study, we randomly selected patients who filled a prescription for varenicline as part of their smoking cessation process and were partnered. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire 26–52 weeks after the first varenicline purchase. The independent variables were the partner’s smoking status at the beginning of the smoking cessation process and while answering the questionnaire. The outcome was a success in the quitting process. RESULTS In all, 226 (50\%) participants had partners who smoked at the beginning of the quitting process, and 230 (50\%) had non-smoking partners; 178 (39\%) participants reported successful smoking cessation. There was a significant difference in success rates depending on partners’ smoking status at the end of the process, with success rates of 39\% with a non-smoking partner, 76\% with a partner who also stopped smoking, and 31\% with a partner who continued smoking (p{$<$}0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that having a partner who stopped smoking during the quitting process was associated with higher odds of quitting compared with having a non-smoking partner (OR=4.73; 95\% CI: 1.86–12.05). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that both partners quitting was associated with increased odds of successful quitting. Health providers should make efforts to engage both partners in smoking cessation.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Previous research focused on CHBs as rather stable beliefs (trait). Some studies indicated that situation-specific CHBs (state) might be important in situations, in which people are confronted with an unhealthy snack. This study aims to investigate the association between CHBs and unhealthy snack consumption in daily life with a special focus on the distinction between trait and state CHBs. Overall, N~=~45 participants (66.7\% female; age: 18–45 years, M~=~21.9) received a link to an online questionnaire five times daily for seven consecutive days (n~=~1575 possible diary entries). They reported unhealthy snack consumption, state and trait CHBs concerning the compensation with subsequent eating behavior and physical activity. The results showed that trait and state CHBs were significantly positively related to unhealthy snack consumption in daily life. Different effects appeared for CHBs concerning the compensation with subsequent eating behavior compared to the compensation with physical activity. This study demonstrates that both, state and trait CHBs are important for unhealthy snack consumption in daily life. Findings emphasize the need for further daily diary approaches to understand the temporal sequence of state CHBs that could further explain the use of CHBs as a maladaptive strategy for unhealthy eating.},

  abstract = {Friendships are an important source of happiness, well-being, physical health, and longevity. Researchers have often linked unidimensional friendship quality to life satisfaction and positive affect, which are hedonic forms of well-being. Aristotle presented an expanded view of friendship with three general characteristics: Utility, Pleasure, and Virtue. Following his theory, we expected Pleasure and Utility characteristics to be primarily related to hedonic well-being (HWB). In contrast, we expected Virtue characteristics to be more strongly related to eudaimonic well-being (EWB), which includes meaning, personal growth, and positive relationships in this study. This exploratory study assessed Aristotle’s theory about friendship and well-being with 375 participants. Two exploratory structural equation models were tested. There was an indirect relationship between Utility characteristics and HWB through Help Received. A friend’s Virtue characteristics had an indirect relationship with EWB through the reliability of the friendship. These findings indicate that friendship characteristics related to utility and virtue friendships appear to have differential implications for understanding the role of friends in happiness and flourishing.},

Little is known, however, about whether this process varies in married versus unmarried individuals managing a chronic illness in which health behaviors are a key component. Researchers have proposed that social control attempts may have dual effects on recipients’ well-being, such that improved health behaviors may occur at the cost of increased emotional distress. The current study accordingly sought to examine marital status differences in the sources, frequency, and responses to health-related social control in an ethnically diverse sample of 1477 patients with type 2 diabetes from southern California, USA. Results from two-way ANCOVAs revealed that married individuals reported their spouses most frequently as sources of social control, with unmarried women naming children and unmarried men naming friends/neighbors most frequently as sources of social control. Married men reported receiving social control most often, whereas unmarried men reported receiving social control least often. Regression analyses that examined behavioral and emotional responses to social control revealed that social control using persuasion was associated with better dietary behavior among married patients. Results also revealed a complex pattern of emotional responses, such that social control was associated with both appreciation and hostility, with the effect for appreciation most pronounced among women. Findings from this study highlight the importance of marital status and gender differences in social network members’ involvement in the management of a chronic illness.},

  abstract = {Objective: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients experience debilitating side effects, including abnormally reduced salivation and difficulty swallowing. Intensive self-care protocols are prescribed to control side effects and minimise discomfort, but non-adherence rates are high. Although spouses are in a prime position to encourage adherence, studies have yet to examine how spouse social control (i.e. attempts to influence patient behaviour to support adherence) affects HNC patient mood and self-efficacy for engaging in these self-care routines. Methods: One-hundred twenty-five HNC couples, where the patient (86\% male) was undergoing radiotherapy, were recorded in the laboratory as they discussed a cancer-related issue that the patient identified as being a topic of concern. Results: Sixty-eight couples discussed side effects and spouses engaged in social control in 61 of these discussions. Although oral complications and pain were frequently identified by patients as being topics of concern, dental/oral care and pain management were some of the least likely self-care behaviours to be targeted by spouses, who focused primarily on encouraging patients to maintain their weight and hydration. Although spouses engaged in an almost equal number of positive and negative control attempts, only positive control was significantly (p~{$<~$}.05) associated with patient positive mood and self-efficacy. Conclusion: HNC couples may benefit from programmes that emphasise the regular practise of self-care routines to control oral side effects, pain and nutrition/hydration problems. Likewise, programmes that encourage spouses to maximise their use of positive social control may also boost patients’ mood during treatment and empower them to engage in recommended self-care behaviours.},

  abstract = {Consistent physical activity is key for health and well-being, but it is vulnerable to stressors. The process of recovering from such stressors and bouncing back to the previous state of physical activity can be referred to as resilience. Quantifying resilience is fundamental to assess and manage the impact of stressors on consistent physical activity. In this tutorial, we present a method to quantify the resilience process from physical activity data. We leverage the prior operationalization of resilience, as used in various psychological domains, as area under the curve and expand it to suit the characteristics of physical activity time series. As use case to illustrate the methodology, we quantified resilience in step count time series (length~=~366 observations) for eight participants following the first COVID-19 lockdown as a stressor. Steps were assessed daily using wrist-worn devices. The methodology is implemented in R and all coding details are included. For each person’s time series, we fitted multiple growth models and identified the best one using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Then, we used the predicted values from the selected model to identify the point in time when the participant recovered from the stressor and quantified the resulting area under the curve as a measure of resilience for step count. Further resilience features were extracted to capture the different aspects of the process. By developing a methodological guide with a step-by-step implementation, we aimed at fostering increased awareness about the concept of resilience for physical activity and facilitate the implementation of related research.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Results indicated that individuals whose partner participated reported the highest levels of relationship and individual well-being relative to comparison groups, and individuals who participated alone despite being asked to invite their partner reported the lowest levels of relationship and individual well-being relative to comparison groups. Effect size magnitudes indicated the strongest group differences with respect to relationship variables, particularly cognitive appraisals of overall relationship stability and satisfaction.

The developmental model emphasizes that dyadic coping may be different at various phases of the life span, changing temporally at different stages of dealing with the illness as well as unfolding daily as spouses interact around dyadic stressors. In addition, couples engaged in dyadic coping are affected by broad sociocultural factors (culture and gender) as well as more proximal contextual factors (quality of the marital relationship and the specific demands of the chronic illness). The model provides a framework for understanding how couples coping with chronic illness may together appraise and cope with illness during adulthood and for determining when spousal involvement is beneficial or harmful to both patient and spousal adjustment. The developmental-contextual model to dyadic appraisal and coping has numerous research implications for the field, and the authors conclude with specific recommendations for future research.

Understanding whether interventions target key determinants of behaviour change is crucial for effective intervention development. This study tested the effects of the SmokeFree Buddy app, which encourages smoking cessation with the help of a buddy, on theoretically derived and pre-registered psychosocial determinants. Methods A total of 162 adults intending to quit smoking were randomized to an intervention (N = 81; SmokeFree Buddy app + assessments) or a control group (N = 81; assessments only). All participants completed end-of-day diaries for 3 days at baseline, from 7 days before to 20 days after a self-set quit date and for 3 days at the 6 months follow-up, reporting on daily amount and quality of support receipt, self-efficacy and action control. Results Multilevel analyses showed that participants in the intervention group had higher daily self-efficacy and were more likely to report daily support receipt (yes/no) from the quit date on until 20 days after compared to participants in the control group. However, on support days, the amount and quality of support were lower for intervention group participants. No group differences 6 months later emerged. In both groups, action control significantly increased from baseline to post-quit. Conclusions Findings showed that the SmokeFree Buddy app was effective in fostering self-efficacy and increasing the likelihood of support interactions in the social network during a quit attempt. Contrary to expectations, it did not necessarily foster higher quality support, suggesting that a differentiated view on support dynamics is needed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Keeping a physically active lifestyle requires consistent self-regulatory effort such as action control (e.g., continuously monitoring and evaluating a behavior in terms of one’s goals). Involving the romantic partner in interventions might be particularly effective in the long run. The present study examined the long-term and transfer effects of an action control intervention in couples using text messaging for promoting target persons’ and partners’ physical activity, anthropometric measures and physical fitness 6 months post baseline. A total of 121 overweight and obese romantic couples, randomly allocated to an intervention ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 60; information + action control text messages) or a control group ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 61; information only) and to participating as target person or partner, completed baseline assessments (T1). 100 couples (82.6\%) completed the 6-month follow-up (T3) assessment. Primary outcomes included self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and objective MVPA and MVPA adherence using triaxial accelerometers across a diary period of 14 days after T3. Secondary outcomes included BMI, waist-to-hip circumference and physical fitness (target persons only) using a submaximal aerobic cycle test. At T3, there were no significant between-group differences between target persons and partners with regard to their objective MVPA, self-reported MVPA, BMI, waist-hip ratio or physical fitness. No significant changes in outcomes were observed from T1 to T3; however, changes in BMI from T1 to T3 between target persons and partners in the intervention group were associated. Overall, the brief 14-days action control intervention was not effective in improving target person’s physical activity, body measures and physical fitness in the long-term. Moreover, no long-term benefits for partners emerged. While brief ecological momentary interventions might be a promising tool for short-term effects, future studies are needed to test features enhancing long-term effectiveness. Associations in romantic partners’ changes suggest that dyadic interventions can be a promising approach, as changes induced in one partner may then transfer over to the other ({$<$}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://controlled-trials.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{$>$}controlled-trials.com{$<$}/ext-link{$>$} ISRCTN15705531).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Daily persuasion was linked to higher daily approach motives. At the person level, persuasion was associated with higher approach and avoidance motives in addition to more frequent, longer exercise. Pressure was associated with higher daily relationship stress, which was associated with higher daily avoidance motives. At the person level, pressure was related to less frequent, shorter exercise. Thus, romantic partners’ social control use correlates with exercise motives and behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objectives               An important element of mindfulness-based interventions is~daily at-home mindfulness practice. However, maintaining regular practice is a challenge for many participants. This study examined the influence of a dyadic support intervention—a “buddy intervention”—on adherence to mindfulness practice in terms of practice frequency and duration.                                         Method                                In this quasi-experimental study, 40 participants (age                 M                 \,=\,38.69,                 SD                 \,=\,13.04) participating in an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) program were assigned to an intervention or control condition. From Session 3, intervention participants were paired with a buddy to support each other’s practice throughout the course.                                                        Results               Participants in the dyadic support condition maintained a stable frequency of practice sessions per week across the intervention period, while those in the control condition showed a significant decline. This was reflected in a significant interaction between condition (dyadic support vs control) and time. Feedback from 17 participants indicated that most experienced the intervention as positive, though some reported challenges like fading contact and difficulty with texting. Contact frequency ranged from less than once a week to daily, with emotional support being the most common strategy.                                         Conclusions               This pilot study highlights the potential of a dyadic intervention to enhance adherence to mindfulness practice, offering a promising and easily implementable strategy for MBI program. Further larger-scale research using proper randomisation is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects.

  abstract = {Sustaining physical activity is essential for long-term health benefits, yet most theory-driven interventions often show only short-lived effects. The reliance on effortful self-control may be critical for promoting behavioral maintenance and explaining why autonomous motivation and habit support long-term engagement in physical activity. This investigation was cross-sectional and examined whether effortful self-control is associated with physical activity behavior (Study 1) and whether it mediates the associations between autonomous motivation and habit with physical activity (Study 2). We also tested whether temptations mediate the associations between autonomous motivation and habit with effortful self-control. In Study 1, 897 adults completed a single-item measure of effortful self-control and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). In Study 2, 603 adults completed multi-item measures of effortful self-control, autonomous motivation, habit, and temptations, along with self-reported MVPA. In Study 1, higher effortful self-control was associated with lower MVPA, rs~=~−.56, 95~\% CI [-.61, −.51]. This association was replicated in Study 2, rs~=~−.51, 95~\% CI [-.58, −.44]. Mediation analyses showed that the relationships between autonomous motivation and habit with MVPA have a significant indirect effect through effortful self-control. Additionally, temptations partially mediated the associations between both motivational constructs and effortful self-control. These findings provide preliminary support for the role of effortful self-control as a psychological process linking autonomous motivation and habit with physical activity behavior. Reducing the amount of effortful self-control for physical activity, by strengthening motivation for physical activity and weakening temptations, may be a promising strategy to support sustained engagement in physical activity.},

  abstract = {Unhealthy behavior is responsible for much human disease, and a common goal of contemporary preventive medicine is therefore to encourage behavior change. However, while behavior change often seems easy in the short run, it can be difficult to sustain. This article provides a selective review of research from the basic learning and behavior laboratory that provides some insight into why. The research suggests that methods used to create behavior change (including extinction, counterconditioning, punishment, reinforcement of alternative behavior, and abstinence reinforcement) tend to inhibit, rather than erase, the original behavior. Importantly, the inhibition, and thus behavior change more generally, is often specific to the “context” in which it is learned. In support of this view, the article discusses a number of lapse and relapse phenomena that occur after behavior has been changed (renewal, spontaneous recovery, reinstatement, rapid reacquisition, and resurgence). The findings suggest that changing a behavior can be an inherently unstable and unsteady process; frequent lapses should be expected. In the long run, behavior-change therapies might benefit from paying attention to the context in which behavior change occurs.},

  abstract = {Background               Research has established the effects of romantic relationships on individuals’ morbidity and mortality. However, the interplay between relationship functioning, affective processes, and health behaviors has been relatively understudied. During the COVID-19 pandemic, relational processes may influence novel health behaviors such as social distancing and masking.                                         Objective               We describe the design, recruitment, and methods of the relationships, risk perceptions, and cancer-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic study. This study was developed to understand how relational and affective processes influence romantic partners’ engagement in cancer prevention behaviors as well as health behaviors introduced or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.                                         Methods               The relationships, risk perceptions, and cancer-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic study used online survey methods to recruit and enroll 2 cohorts of individuals involved in cohabiting romantic relationships, including 1 cohort of dyads (n=223) and 1 cohort of cancer survivors (n=443). Survey assessments were completed over 2 time points that were 5.57 (SD 3.14) weeks apart on average. Health behaviors assessed included COVID-19 vaccination and social distancing, physical activity, diet, sleep, alcohol use, and smoking behavior. We also examined relationship factors, psychological distress, and household chaos.                                         Results               Data collection occurred between October 2021 and August 2022. During that time, a total of 926 participants were enrolled, of which about two-thirds were from the United Kingdom (n=622, 67.8\%) and one-third were from the United States (n=296, 32.2\%); about two-thirds were married (n=608, 66.2\%) and one-third were members of unmarried couples (n=294, 32\%). In cohorts 1 and 2, the mean age was about 34 and 50, respectively. Out of 478 participants in cohort 1, 19 (4\%) identified as Hispanic or Latino/a, 79 (17\%) as non-Hispanic Asian, 40 (9\%) as non-Hispanic Black or African American, and 306 (64\%) as non-Hispanic White; 62 (13\%) participants identified their sexual orientation as bisexual or pansexual, 359 (75.1\%) as heterosexual or straight, and 53 (11\%) as gay or lesbian. In cohort 2, out of 440 participants, 13 (3\%) identified as Hispanic or Latino/a, 8 (2\%) as non-Hispanic Asian, 5 (1\%) as non-Hispanic Black or African American, and 398 (90.5\%) as non-Hispanic White; 41 (9\%) participants identified their sexual orientation as bisexual or pansexual, 384 (87.3\%) as heterosexual or straight, and 13 (3\%) as gay or lesbian. The overall enrollment rate for individuals was 66.14\% and the overall completion rate was 80.08\%.                                         Conclusions               We discuss best practices for collecting online survey data for studies examining relationships and health, challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment of underrepresented populations, and enrollment of dyads. Recommendations include conducting pilot studies, allowing for extra time in the data collection timeline for marginalized or underserved populations, surplus screening to account for expected attrition within dyads, as well as planning dyad-specific data quality checks.

Participants were randomized to three intervention arms: Physical Activity, Weight Loss\,+\,Physical Activity, or a Successful Aging education control.Across 18~months, the Weight Loss\,+\,Physical Activity intervention demonstrated greater improvements in self-efficacy, satisfaction with function, and appearance versus other trial arms. Physical Activity intervention participants also experienced significant improvements in self-efficacy and satisfaction with function versus those in Successful Aging. Self-efficacy mediated 400-m walk time at 18~months.Both group-mediated cognitive–behavioral interventions yielded desirable improvements in social cognitions and preserved mobility improvements post-intervention.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00119795}

Social control reflects a partner’s attempt to modify or influence a patient’s health behaviors. We hypothesized that the best outcome for all continuous glucose monitoring measures would be captured by an interaction condition reflecting invisible social control. Method: Patients with Type 2 diabetes and their partners (N = 63 couples) completed an 8-day daily diary period between 2016 and 2017. Self-report measures of social control receipt and provision were obtained each evening from patients and partners and patients wore a continuous glucose monitor throughout the diary period. Outcomes of daily glucose mean, standard deviation, time in range, and coefficient of variation were computed and two-way interactions between social control receipt and social control provision were probed and plotted. Results: The two-way interaction significantly predicted daily glucose mean, standard deviation, and time in range, such that when patients reported no social control receipt, but partners reported social control provision, patients showed improvements in objective glucose measures. We found no significant effect for coefficient of variation. Conclusions: This study was the first to use an invisible social control framework to examine the daily dyadic associations between partner social control provision, patient social control receipt, and four objectively measured continuous glucose monitoring outcomes. Findings suggest that the visibility of social control provided by a romantic partner may be predictive of glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {Physiological reactivity to acute stress has been proposed as a potential biological mechanism by which loneliness may lead to negative health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. This review was conducted to investigate the association between loneliness and physiological responses to acute stress. A series of electronic databases were systematically searched (PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL Plus, EBSCOhost, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct) for relevant studies, published up to October 2016. Eleven studies were included in the review. Overall, the majority of studies reported positive associations between loneliness and acute stress responses, such that higher levels of loneliness were predictive of exaggerated physiological reactions. However, in a few studies, loneliness was also linked with decreased stress responses for particular physiological outcomes, indicating the possible existence of blunted relationships. There was no clear pattern suggesting any sex- or stressor-based differences in these associations. The available evidence supports a link between loneliness and atypical physiological reactivity to acute stress. A key finding of this review was that greater levels of loneliness are associated with exaggerated blood pressure and inflammatory reactivity to acute stress. However, there was some indication that loneliness may also be related to blunted cardiac, cortisol, and immune responses. Overall, this suggests that stress reactivity could be one of the biological mechanisms through which loneliness impacts upon health.},

Baseline indicators of giving and receiving support were used to predict mortality status over a 5-year period in the Changing Lives of Older Couples sample. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that mortality was significantly reduced for individuals who reported providing instrumental support to friends, relatives, and neighbors, and individuals who reported providing emotional support to their spouse. Receiving support had no effect on mortality once giving support was taken into consideration. This pattern of findings was obtained after controlling for demographic, personality, health, mental health, and marital-relationship variables. These results have implications for understanding how social contact influences health and longevity.},

A stimulus–response (S–R) system that encourages us to efficiently repeat well-practiced actions in familiar settings, and a goal-directed system concerned with flexibility, prospection, and planning. Getting the balance between these systems right is crucial: an imbalance may leave people vulnerable to action slips, impulsive behaviors, and even compulsive behaviors. In this review we examine how recent advances in our understanding of these competing brain mechanisms can be harnessed to increase the control over both making and breaking habits. We discuss applications in everyday life, as well as validated and emergent interventions for clinical populations affected by the balance between these systems. As research in this area accelerates, we anticipate a rapid influx of new insights into intentional behavioral change and clinical interventions, including new opportunities for personalization of these interventions based on the neurobiology, environmental context, and personal preferences of an individual.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Die Eltern-Kind-Beziehung im Erwachsenenalter kann in Anlehnung an individuationstheoretische Konzeptionen anhand der übergeordneten Faktoren Verbundenheit und Abgrenzung beschrieben werden. Zugleich postuliert der individuationstheoretische Ansatz Beziehungsdyamik, insbesondere im Bereich der Abgrenzung. Empirische Evidenzen sprechen darüber hinaus für Veränderungen auch im Bereich der Verbundenheit, die oft in Zusammenhang mit biographischen Übergängen beobachtet worden sind. In Weiterführung vorliegender Arbeiten, mit denen vor allem private Übergänge untersucht wurden, ist die Transition in den Beruf Gegenstand dieses Artikels. Dazu wurden Studierende und Berufstätige im frühen Erwachsenenalter sowie nach Möglichkeit beide Eltern befragt. Es nahmen 130 junge Erwachsene (Alter 21 bis 34 Jahre), 114 Mütter (40 bis 73 Jahre) und 89 Väter (43 bis 75 Jahre) teil. Abgrenzung und Verbundenheit wurden jeweils anhand eines Fragebogens hinsichtlich emotionaler, kognitiver und behavioraler Merkmale erfasst. In den Angaben der Kinder, nicht aber in denen der Eltern, zeigen sich Unterschiede zwischen Studierenden und Berufstätigen, die sich als weniger verbunden und stärker abgegrenzt beschreiben. Es finden sich Generationen- und Geschlechtsunterschiede, letztere besonders zwischen Müttern und Vätern. Die Ergebnisse werden als Erweiterung individuationstheoretischer Arbeiten diskutiert.},

Actor–partner interdependence mediation models (APIMeM) were used to examine the reports of diet- and exercise-related social control in 192 couples. In line with the accuracy and bias framework, we found that couples are accurate and biased with regard to their social control attempts and that accuracy and bias were associated with relationship satisfaction for positive social control. Individuals also reported greater relationship satisfaction when they reported using less negative social control and when they perceived more positive social control from their partners. These findings provide corroboration for self-reports of social influence in close relationships while simultaneously demonstrating bias in perceptions of partners’ social control and highlighting concurrent associations with people’s relationship satisfaction.},

  abstract = {In cluster randomized trials (CRTs), clusters of individuals are randomized rather than the individuals themselves. For such trials, power depends in part on the degree of similarity among responses within a cluster, which is quantified by the intaclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Thus, for a fixed sample size, power decreases with increasing ICC. In reliability studies with two observers, dichotomizing a continuous outcome variable has been shown to reduce the ICC. We checked (by a simulation study) that this property still applies to CRTs, in which cluster sizes are variable and usually greater than in reliability studies and observations (within clusters) are exchangeable. Then, in a CRT, dichotomizing a continuous outcome actually induces two antagonistic effects: decreased power because of loss of information and increased power induced by attenuation of the ICC. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of dichotomizing a continuous outcome on power in a CRT. We derived an analytical formula for power based on a generalized estimating equation approach after dichotomizing a continuous outcome. This theoretical result was obtained by considering equal cluster sizes, and we then assessed its accuracy (by a simulation study) in the more realistic situation of varying cluster sizes. We showed that dichotomization is associated with decreased power: attenuation of the ICC does not compensate for the loss of power induced by loss of information. Loss of power is reduced with increased initial continuous-outcome ICC and/or prevalence of success for the dichotomized outcome approaching 50\%. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The open-science movement seeks to make research more transparent and accessible. To that end, researchers are increasingly expected to share de-identified data with other scholars for review, reanalysis, and reuse. In psychology, open-science practices have been explored primarily within the context of quantitative data, but demands to share qualitative data are becoming more prevalent. Narrative data are far more challenging to de-identify fully, and because qualitative methods are often used in studies with marginalized, minoritized, and/or traumatized populations, data sharing may pose substantial risks for participants if their information can be later reidentified. To date, there has been little guidance in the literature on how to de-identify qualitative data. To address this gap, we developed a methodological framework for remediating sensitive narrative data. This multiphase process is modeled on common qualitative-coding strategies. The first phase includes consultations with diverse stakeholders and sources to understand reidentifiability risks and data-sharing concerns. The second phase outlines an iterative process for recognizing potentially identifiable information and constructing individualized remediation strategies through group review and consensus. The third phase includes multiple strategies for assessing the validity of the de-identification analyses (i.e., whether the remediated transcripts adequately protect participants’ privacy). We applied this framework to a set of 32 qualitative interviews with sexual-assault survivors. We provide case examples of how blurring and redaction techniques can be used to protect names, dates, locations, trauma histories, help-seeking experiences, and other information about dyadic interactions.},

  abstract = {Latent Change Score models (LCS) are a popular tool for the study of dynamics in longitudinal research. They represent processes in which the short-term dynamics have direct and indirect consequences on the long-term behavior of the system. However, this dual interpretation of the model parameters is usually overlooked in the literature, and researchers often find it difficult to see the connection between parameters and specific patterns of change. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the meaning and interpretation of the parameters in LCS models. Importantly, we focus on their relation to the shape of the trajectories and explain how different specifications of the LCS model involve particular assumptions about the mechanisms of change. On a supplementary website, we present an interactive Shiny App that allows users to explore different sets of parameter values and examine their effects on the predicted trajectories. We also include fully explained code to estimate some of the most relevant specifications of the LCS model with the R-packages               lavaan               and               OpenMx               .},

Sixty-nine studies were identified from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, and 59 were included in the main meta-analyses (providing 72 independent tests). Intervention details, type of dyadic goal, participant characteristics, and methodological quality were extracted and their impact on the overall effect size was examined. Sensitivity analyses tested effect robustness to (a) the effects of other statistically significant moderators; (b) outliers; (c) data included for participants who were not the main target of the intervention. Dyadic interventions had a small positive, highly heterogeneous, effect on PA g = .203, 95\% CI [0.123–0.282], compared to comparison conditions including equivalent interventions targeting individuals. Shared targetoriented goals (where both dyad members hold the same PA goal for the main target of the intervention) and peer/friend dyads were associated with larger effect sizes across most analyses. Dyadic interventions produced a small homogeneous reduction in SB. Given dyadic interventions promote PA over-and-above equivalent interventions targeting individuals, these interventions should be more widespread. However, moderating factors such as the types of PA goal and dyad need to be considered to maximise effects.},

  abstract = {Objectives The number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit successfully is a commonly reported figure among smoking cessation programmes, but previous estimates have been based on lifetime recall in cross-sectional samples of successful quitters only. The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations.},

The prevalence of obesity has increased from 23\% to 31\% over the recent past in the United States, and 66\% of adults are overweight.1,2 Proposed explanations for the obesity epidemic include societal changes that promote both inactivity and food consumption.3 The fact that the increase in obesity during this period cannot be explained by genetics4,5 and has occurred among all socioeconomic groups1 provides support for a broad set of social and environmental explanations. Since diverse phenomena can spread within social networks,6–10 we conducted a study to determine whether obesity might also spread from person to person, possibly .~.~.},

Significant actor and partner effects were found for both self-ratings and peer nominations of social behaviour and the five friendship qualities. Aggression was associated with self and partner perceptions of friendship conflict and low positive friendship qualities. Prosocial behaviour was associated with self and partner perceptions of positive friendship qualities and low conflict.

This argument suggests a broader view of how to intervene in social networks to improve health. This includes facilitating both social integration and social support by creating and nurturing both close (strong) and peripheral (weak) ties within natural social networks and reducing opportunities for negative social interaction. Finally, the author emphasizes the necessity to understand more about who benefits most and least from social-connectedness interventions.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This review applied meta-analytic procedures to integrate primary research findings that test interventions to increase activity among aging adults. METHODS: We performed extensive literature searching strategies and located published and unpublished intervention studies that measured the activity behavior of at least five participants with a mean age of 60 years or greater. Primary study results were coded, and meta-analytic procedures were conducted. RESULTS: The overall effect size, weighted by sample size, was d(w) = .26 +/- .05. Effect sizes were larger when interventions targeted only activity behavior, excluded general health education, incorporated self-monitoring, used center-based exercise, recommended moderate intensity activity, were delivered in groups, used intense contact between interventionists and participants, and targeted patient populations. Effect sizes were larger for studies that measured exercise duration and studies with a time interval of less than 90 days between intervention and behavior measurement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that group-delivered interventions should encourage moderate activity, incorporate self-monitoring, target only activity, and encourage center-based activity. Findings also suggest that patient populations may be especially receptive to activity interventions. Primary research testing interventions in randomized trials to confirm causal relationships would be constructive.},

In this article we present the APIM as a general, longitudinal model for measuring bidirectional effects in interpersonal relationships. We also present three different approaches to testing the model. The statistical analysis of the APIM is illustrated using longitudinal data on relationship specific attachment security from 203 mother–adolescent dyads. The results support the view that interpersonal influence on attachment security is bidirectional. Moreover, consistent with a hypothesis from attachment theory, the degree to which a child’s attachment security is influenced by his or her primary caregiver is found to diminish with age.},

  abstract = {Despite the disease prevention benefits of engaging in life-long regular physical activity, many adults remain sedentary. The social environment provides an important context for health and health behavior across the lifespan, as well as a potential point of intervention for increasing physical activity. Self-reports of perceived social support, social strain, positive social control, and negative social control were examined for their cross-sectional relationships to physical activity frequency in purposive samples of younger and older adults (N = 371, ages from 18 to 97, 68\% women). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceived support and perceived strain were not correlated with physical activity. However, age and sex interacted with social control, such that more positive social control was associated with more frequent physical activity for younger men. Furthermore, more positive and negative social control were significantly associated with less frequent physical activity for older men, while social control was not associated with physical activity among women. While younger men may be encouraged toward healthier behaviors by positive social control messages, social control attempts may backfire when targeting older men. Implications for physical activity promotion are discussed.},

Social relations have been proposed as influential precursors for exercise self-efficacy. In a longitudinal study of 160 older adults with osteoarthritis (76.9\% women), the authors found that social support (but not social strain) significantly predicted exercise self-efficacy in a structural equation model examining cross-sectional data:                                χ                 2                 (                              17               8, N               = 160) = 264.57,               p               {$<$} .01; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .92; TLI = .90. When data were examined longitudinally, however, social strain (but not social support) significantly predicted lower exercise self-efficacy 1 year later: χ               2               (233,               N               = 160) = 288.64,               p               {$<$} .01; RMSEA = .04; CFI = .96; TLI = .95.

  abstract = {This paper uses the Experience Sampling Method data drawn from a national sample of American youth. It examines the proximal environmental factors as well as behaviors and habits that correlate to personal happiness. Momentary-level scores show that reported happiness varies significantly both by day of week and time of day. Furthermore, particular activities are associated with varying degrees of happiness. School activities rate below average scores in happiness, while social, active and passive leisure activities are above average. Particular companions also correlate to differing level of happiness. Being alone rates the lowest levels of happiness, while being with friend corresponds to the highest. Person-level averages of happiness suggest that both higher social class and age correlate with lower levels of happiness, while gender and race do not. Paradoxically, youth who spend more time in school and social activities are happier than those who spend less. Unexpectedly, students who spend more time pleasure reading report lower levels of happiness. Finally, feeling good about the self, excited, proud, sociable, active as well as being in the conditions for flow experience are the strongest predictors of trait happiness.},

Validität: Die faktorielle Validität wurde mehrfach und auf unterschiedliche Weise untersucht. Strukturgleichungsmodelle belegen die Annahme, dass zwischen einem aktuellen und einem habituellen Wohlbefinden und erst innerhalb dieser zwischen emotionalen und kognitiven Anteilen getrennt wird. Die Korrelation zwischen Stimmungsniveau und Lebenszufriedenheit (Trait-Trait-Korrelation: r = .67) war enger als die Korrelationen der beiden habituellen mit den drei aktuellen Stimmungsmaßen (Trait-State-Korrelationen: r = .28/.42). Beide HSBWS-Skalen korrelierten geringfügig, aber signifikant mit der Tendenz zu sozial erwünschtem Antwortverhalten.

We discuss SDT research relevant to the workplace, focusing on (a) the distinction between autonomous motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation and fully internalized extrinsic motivation) and controlled motivation (i.e., externally and internally controlled extrinsic motivation), as well as (b) the postulate that all employees have three basic psychological needs—for competence, autonomy, and relatedness—the satisfaction of which promotes autonomous motivation, high-quality performance, and wellness. Research in work organizations has tended to take the perspectives of either the employees (i.e., their well-being) or the owners (i.e., their profits). SDT provides the concepts that guide the creation of policies, practices, and environments that promote both wellness and high-quality performance. We examine the relations of SDT to transformational leadership, job characteristics, justice, and compensation approaches.},

Regression analysis was used to test associations between objectively measured light PA, moderate to vigorous PA, and total PA; loneliness; and SI from family, neighbors, or friends and to explore these associations using specific activities. Daily mean light, moderate to vigorous, and total PA were not associated with loneliness or SI. Volunteering, accompanying others, and sports/exercise were associated with lower SI from neighbors (odds ratio\,=\,0.23, 95\% CI [0.06, 0.91]), family (odds ratio\,=\,0.39, 95\% CI [0.22, 0.68]), and friends (odds ratio\,=\,0.56, 95\% CI [0.33, 0.97]), respectively. There were no associations between loneliness, SI, and objectively measured PA. The contribution of PA to loneliness and SI needs to be further investigated with larger and diverse samples of rural-living older adults.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Smoking habit cessation is undoubtedly a strenuous, extremely demanding and stressful process for smokers; therefore treatment should focus on timely cessation and relapse prevention. The aim of this study is to assess irritability, depression, anxiety and the health-related quality of life of patients visiting a smoking cessation clinic, during both all 3 phases of the treatment and 1 year after completion. Methods: The participants of the study were 97 people who attended the smoking cessation department of a public tertiary hospital of the capital of Greece. The study consists of 4 phases that took place at intervals of 1, 3, and 12 months respectively. A specially designed questionnaire was used to collect demographic characteristics of the sample and of factors related to their smoking behavior as well as EuroQol (EQ-5D), Fagestrom scale and Snaith-IDA irritability scale. Results: Results demonstrated positive outcomes both in terms of participation and smoking cessation. Calculations performed by using the Fagestrom Test of Nicotine Dependence showed that 36.2\% highly dependent, showing that it was difficult for them to quit smoking permanently. EQ-5D questionnaire results imply that participants are faced with some problems walking, but not to the point of being unable to take care of themselves; however, they do seem to have some problems in carrying out usual activities. Forty-three percent of the sample admitted to moderate pain or indisposition in phase 1, whereas again in phase 1 (first month of the smoking cessation treatment), 78.9\% showed signs of moderate anxiety or depression. Correlation of EQ-D5 VAS values between phases 2 and 3, shows that there is statistically significant correlation with a p-value at .001 revealing that the perceived level of quality of life of individuals in phase 2 (completion of smoking cessation program) is higher (70.43) than in phase 3 (one year after) (67.39). Conclusions: The present study shows that the smoking cessation process affects positively quality of life in all its aspects, reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms.},

However, most have examined the benefits of intrapersonal or trait mindfulness, rather than directly investigating interpersonal mindfulness or considering polyvagal theory. Our main objective was to determine the variable importance of interpersonal mindfulness and psychological safety for relationship and sexual satisfaction using random forests and regression trees and to explore the importance of demographics, social and couple‐related factors, and emotional wellbeing in this analysis. 356 adults in committed romantic relationships were recruited for a self‐report survey. Results suggested that mindfulness in couple relationships, psychological safety, conflict strategies, and depression symptoms were of top importance for relationship and sexual satisfaction. Limitations and future directions involving dyadic data and physiological measures were discussed. The findings will inform the development of interpersonal mindfulness‐ and polyvagal‐based interventions aimed at promoting safety and stability in relationships while enhancing personal wellbeing.},

Instruments included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and 16PF. In Studies 1 and 2, positive feelings were remembered as being nearly independent of negative feelings in the past year, but the 2 types of affect were moderately negatively correlated for the past month. In Studies 3 and 5, Ss completed daily mood reports for 70 and 30 days, respectively. In Study 4, Ss completed 3-wk, daily, and moment mood reports and also filled out reports when they experienced strong emotions. The principal finding was that the relation between positive and negative affect differed greatly depending on the time frame. The strongest negative correlation between the 2 affects occurred during emotional times. The correlation decreased in a linear fashion as the time span covered increased logarithmically. It appears that positive and negative affect are independent in terms of how much people feel in their lives over longer time periods.

  abstract = {Social integration and social support have a substantial influence on individual health and longevity, an effect assumed to be mediated through reduced stress reactivity in support recipients. However, considerable variability in individual responses to social support has been documented, suggesting that the beneficial effect of social support interacts with early experiences, genetically influenced differences in biological systems mediating social behavior, personality traits, and psychopathology. Here we outline the historical background of social support research, including epidemiological studies, laboratory studies, and field studies on the subject of social support and health, with regard to different psychobiological effector systems. Most recent research has focused on brain mechanisms which link social integration or social support with reduced neural threat responses. As numerous mental disorders are associated with considerable social impairment, understanding the potentially underlying mechanisms of neural plasticity in relation to social support, stress buffering and health in these disorders can help tailor new diagnostic and treatment strategies. Thus, theories of socially-driven emotional learning and memory, as presented in this review, might eventually lead to psychobiology-based treatment concepts for mental disorders involving social deficits.},

The participants were classified as having high spouse support if wife support scores were in the top one third of the distribution and as having low spouse support if scores were in the bottom one third as measured from inquiry of the participant, the spouse, and the staff. The adherence of men having low support averaged 70 percent, significantly lower than the high-support group, which averaged 96 percent. The correlations between spouses' health beliefs and their level of support were significant for three of four health belief variables. In particular, highly adhering men had wives who believed more strongly in the benefits of the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial.},

In particular, cross-lagged regression coefficients may vary, depending on the respective time lags between different sets of measurement occasions. This article introduces the concept of an optimal time lag. Further, it is demonstrated that optimal time lags in panel studies are related to the stabilities of the variables investigated, and that in unidirectional systems, they may be unrelated to the size of possible true effects. The results presented also suggest that optimal time lags for panel designs are usually quite short. Implications are (a) that interpreting cross-lagged regression coefficients requires taking the time lag between measurement occasions into account, and (b) that in much research, far shorter time lags than those frequently found in the literature are justifiable, and we call for more “shortitudinal” studies in the future.

  abstract = {Habits are cue-behavior associations learned through repetition that are assumed to be relatively stable. Thereby, unhealthy habits can pose a health risk due to facilitating relapse. In the absence of research on habit decay in daily life, we aimed to investigate how habit decreases over time when trying to degrade a habit and whether this differs by four health-risk behaviors (sedentary behavior, unhealthy snacking, alcohol consumption, and smoking). This 91-day intensive longitudinal study included four parallel non-randomized groups (one per behavior; N = 194). Habit strength was measured daily with the Self-Report Behavioral Automaticity Index (11,805 observations) and modelled over time with constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, asymptotic, and logistic models. Person-specific modelling revealed asymptotic and logistic models as the most common best-fitting models (54\% of the sample). The time for habit decay to stabilize ranged from 1 to 65 days. Multilevel modelling indicated substantial between-person heterogeneity and suggested initial habit strength but not the decay process to vary by behavioral group. Findings suggest that habit decay when trying to degrade a habit typically follows a decelerating negative trend but that it is a highly idiosyncratic process. Recommendations include emphasizing the role of person-specific modelling and data visualization in habit research.},

Although it has been hypothesized that social support may benefit health by reducing physiological reactivity to stressors, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Moreover, to date, no studies have investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate experiences of social support into the health outcomes that follow. To investigate these processes, thirty participants completed three tasks in which daily social support, neurocognitive reactivity to a social stressor, and neuroendocrine responses to a social stressor were assessed. Individuals who interacted regularly with supportive individuals across a 10-day period showed diminished cortisol reactivity to a social stressor. Moreover, greater social support and diminished cortisol responses were associated with diminished activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and Brodmann’s area (BA) 8, regions previously associated with the distress of social separation. Lastly, individual differences in dACC and BA 8 reactivity mediated the relationship between high daily social support and low cortisol reactivity, such that supported individuals showed reduced neurocognitive reactivity to social stressors, which in turn was associated with reduced neuroendocrine stress responses.

  abstract = {Past research has documented age differences in the size and composition of social networks that suggest that networks grow smaller with age and include an increasingly greater proportion of well-known social partners. According to socioemotional selectivity theory, such changes in social network composition serve an antecedent emotion regulatory function that supports an age-related increase in the priority that people place on emotional well-being. The present study employed a longitudinal design with a sample that spanned the full adult age range to examine whether there is evidence of within-individual (developmental) change in social networks and whether the characteristics of relationships predict emotional experiences in daily life. Using growth curve analyses, social networks were found to increase in size in young adulthood and then decline steadily throughout later life. As postulated by socioemotional selectivity theory, reductions were observed primarily in the number of peripheral partners; the number of close partners was relatively stable over time. In addition, cross-sectional analyses revealed that older adults reported that social network members elicited less negative emotion and more positive emotion. The emotional tone of social networks, particularly when negative emotions were associated with network members, predicted daily emotional experience. These findings were robust after taking into account demographic variables and physical health. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of socioemotional selectivity theory and related theoretical models.},

  abstract = {Introduction               The highest incidence of overweight among adults is found among women, predominantly middle-aged women. While it has been demonstrated that being overweight increases mortality by compromising physical and mental health, it also imposes substantial costs on the healthcare system. Lack of physical activity is a primary contributing factor to becoming overweight. The majority of inactive adults are women, particularly middle-aged women. Consequently, this study investigated the training program for overweight women based on the health belief model (HBM) and social support approach.                                         Methods                                A randomized, controlled trial involving 73 overweight middle-aged women (control group: 37, intervention group: 36) was conducted using simple random sampling. The intervention group participated in six 120-min sessions per week for 6\,weeks of a training program based on HBM and social support through physical activity, group discussion, role play, and media. Data were collected using the Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Bandura’s Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (Bandura’s ESE), and a researcher-made questionnaire before and 4\,weeks after the training. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics via SPSS 27 software.                 p                 -values \&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.                                                        Results                                A training program based on HBM and social support led to improved perceived benefits (                 p                 \,\&lt;\,0.001), cues to action (                 p                 \,=\,0.03), and self-efficacy (                 p                 \,\&lt;\,0.001) of physical activity; decreased perceived barriers (                 p                 \,=\,0.001); increased social support (                 p                 \,=\,0.001); and increased physical activity (                 p                 \,\&lt;\,0.001). In addition, the BMI of the intervention group decreased after the training program (                 p                 \,=\,0.01).                                                        Conclusion               The findings of the study demonstrate the efficacy of the training program based on HBM and the social support approach in improving social support and physical activity of women. In addition, the study evaluates the long-term outcome in populations with varying social, economic, and cultural standings.

At Time 1, couple members completed measures assessing motivations for caregiving, the quality of caregiving that occurs in the relationship, and personal and relationship characteristics that might influence caregiving motivations. Relationship functioning was then assessed 2 to 3 months later. Results revealed that (a) there are a number of distinct motivations for providing and for not providing care to one's partner, (b) the motivations are associated with various personal features of the caregiver and the recipient, (c) the caregiver's perceptions of the relationship influence his or her caregiving motives, (d) different motivations for caregiving predict different patterns of caregiving behavior, and (e) responsive caregiving predicts the recipient's perceptions of healthy relationship functioning both immediately and over time. Implications of identifying the motivations that promote or inhibit the provision of responsive support in intimate relationships are discussed.},

Yet the specific pathways through which close relationships promote optimal well-being are not well understood. In this article, we present a model of thriving through relationships to provide a theoretical foundation for identifying the specific interpersonal processes that underlie the effects of close relationships on thriving. This model highlights two life contexts through which people may potentially thrive (coping successfully with life’s adversities and actively pursuing life opportunities for growth and development), it proposes two relational support functions that are fundamental to the experience of thriving in each life context, and it identifies mediators through which relational support is likely to have long-term effects on thriving. This perspective highlights the need for researchers to take a new look at social support by conceptualizing it as an interpersonal process with a focus on thriving.},

This study examines the relationship among these variables and explores the putative mediating and moderating mechanisms that might account for activity changes.                                         Methods:               A longitudinal study with 54 older adults (≥ 50 years of age) was carried out in Costa Rica. In a moderated mediation analysis, action control was specified as a mediator between self-efficacy and physical activity, whereas social support was specified as a moderator between self-efficacy and action control. Baseline physical activity, age, and sex were specified as covariates.                                         Results:               Action control mediated between self-efficacy and physical activity. An interaction between social support and self-efficacy on action control pointed to a synergistic effect at the first stage of the mediating process.                                         Conclusions:               The effect of self-efficacy on physical activity was partly explained by action control, providing evidence of action control as a proximal mediator of physical activity. Moreover, the moderator role of social support was confirmed: high social support appeared to compensate for low levels of self-efficacy.},

Prior theories have focused on aspects of the older adult (e.g., social cognition, motivation) to explain these findings. We propose a social input model to explain why older adults describe themselves as having better relationships. This model maintains that older adults’ reports of positive social ties reflect both their own actions and those of their social partners. When adults of any age find themselves in a tense interchange with an older adult, they minimize tensions to facilitate positive emotional experiences. These behaviors may stem from perceived time remaining in the relationship, forgiveness or abrogation of blame, and stereotypes of aging. Findings suggest socioemotional regulation in late life involves actions on the part of both older adults and their social partners.},

First, the descriptive side of traits can be conceptualized as density distributions of states. Second, it is important to provide an explanatory account of the Big 5 traits. Third, adding an explanatory account to the Big 5 creates two parts to traits, an explanatory part and a descriptive part, and these two parts can be recognized as separate entities that are joined into whole traits. Fourth, Whole Trait Theory proposes that the explanatory side of traits consists of social-cognitive mechanisms. Fifth, social-cognitive mechanisms that produce Big-5 states should be identified.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological and biological plausibility studies support a cause-and-effect relationship between increased levels of physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness and reduced coronary heart disease events. These data, plus the well-documented anti-aging effects of exercise, have likely contributed to the escalating numbers of adults who have embraced the notion that “more exercise is better.” As a result, worldwide participation in endurance training, competitive long distance endurance events, and high-intensity interval training has increased markedly since the previous American Heart Association statement on exercise risk. On the other hand, vigorous physical activity, particularly when performed by unfit individuals, can acutely increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible people. Recent studies have also shown that large exercise volumes and vigorous intensities are both associated with potential cardiac maladaptations, including accelerated coronary artery calcification, exercise-induced cardiac biomarker release, myocardial fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation. The relationship between these maladaptive responses and physical activity often forms a U- or reverse J-shaped dose-response curve. This scientific statement discusses the cardiovascular and health implications for moderate to vigorous physical activity, as well as high-volume, high-intensity exercise regimens, based on current understanding of the associated risks and benefits. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with updated information to advise patients on appropriate preparticipation screening and the benefits and risks of physical activity or physical exertion in varied environments and during competitive events.},

We review theoretical perspectives relative to studying families and dyads and note how they are connected with dyadic analysis techniques. We note differences in theoretical assumptions underlying the actor–partner interdependence model, the common fate model (CFM), and hybrid models that combine features of both and distinguish between the types of questions each addresses. Using third grade, sixth grade, and age 15 data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ( N = 732), we illustrate the value of using CFM and hybrid models to explore how family chaos is associated with couple conflict resolution and child behavior problems. Dyadic- and family-level analyses may offer additional insight into family functioning, and we provide recommendations for the use of CFM in furthering this line of inquiry.},

Findings show that on days when participants reported more emotional support than usual, fruit and vegetable consumption and step counts were higher. Daily instrumental support was positively associated with step counts, only. Participants receiving more overall emotional support across the study period consumed more fruit and vegetables; no parallel person-level association was found for overall steps.

Because methodological guidance on assessing and reporting reliability at multiple levels of analysis is currently lacking, we discuss the importance of examining level-specific reliability. We present a simulation study and an applied example showing different methods for estimating multilevel reliability using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis and provide supporting Mplus program code. We conclude that (a) single-level estimates will not reflect a scale’s actual reliability unless reliability is identical at each level of analysis, (b) 2-level alpha and composite reliability (omega) perform relatively well in most settings, (c) estimates of maximal reliability (H) were more biased when estimated using multilevel data than either alpha or omega, and (d) small cluster size can lead to overestimates of reliability at the between level of analysis. We also show that Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals closely reflect the sampling distribution of reliability estimates under most conditions. We discuss the estimation of credible intervals using Mplus and provide R code for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Smoking is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite strong recommendations for cessation and the existence of efficacious pharmacological and behavioral interventions, cessation rates remain low. Therefore, in this study, we explore perceived facilitators and barriers to smoking cessation in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who have participated in a cessation intervention study. Methods: Participants (N = 10) from the intervention arm of a randomized controlled study with access to free cessation support and pharmacological aids completed a semi-structured, in-depth telephone interview after the six months follow-up between October 2021 and July 2022. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to principles of thematic analysis. Results: Mean age was 65.7 (range 55 to 79) years, and three out of 10 participants were female. Five had quit smoking, three had relapsed and two were persistent smokers. The themes identified encompassed barriers and facilitators to cessation, both including individual and contextual factors. Barriers included: Upsides of smoking, difficult life situations, addiction to smoking, smoking in social circles, and perceived lack of support and understanding from health professionals. Facilitators included: Intrinsic motivation, concerns about the health condition, financial implications, specific behavioral strategies, positive influence from the social environment, and helpful components of the cessation intervention. Conclusions: Smokers with cardiovascular disease who have attended a cessation intervention study report several facilitators weighted against barriers, interacting with the intention to cease smoking. The most important potentially modifiable factors of significance for cessation identified may be addressed through motivational interviews and focus groups with other smokers.},

A systematic search included studies relating to couple-oriented interventions for preventing mental disorders and/or promoting mental health. We identified a total of 52 studies, which included 55 articles. Our findings revealed that interventions were delivered through various modes, including face-to-face, telephone, and online, with the majority of couple-oriented interventions operating in conjoint sessions. The most common intervention was for selective prevention targeting patients with cancer and their partners. This review provided evidence of the applicability of theoretical frameworks, dyad analysis, and measurements associated with couple-oriented interventions. Findings can help family nurse practitioners and health care professionals advance strategies to develop and implement evidence-based, couple-oriented interventions for primary prevention of mental disorders and the promotion of mental health.},

The authors hypothesized that these negative effects could be offset by support recipients' reciprocation of support, that is, by creating a sense of supportive equity. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors obtained daily reports of mood and of received and given emotional support from both partners in 85 couples throughout a 4-week period. Reciprocity in support transactions was associated with higher levels of positive mood and lower levels of negative mood. In line with previous research, receiving support without reciprocation was associated with increases in negative mood. Giving support, regardless of receipt, was associated with a decrease in negative mood.},

Participants were randomly assigned: individuals in the intervention group kept daily activity records for 6 weeks, mailed to the researcher every 2 weeks. Data collection was completed at the beginning of the study and 6 weeks later, using the habitual physical activity index and the self-efficacy for exercise scale. Participants in the intervention group also completed the perceived feasibility checklist.Results: The intervention resulted in enhanced self-efficacy. Physical activity improved in both the intervention and control groups. Activity recording was judged to be acceptable and feasible.Conclusions: Daily activity recording can be used as part of a program to increase physical activity self-efficacy levels. Focused interactions between health care providers and patients may be enough to motivate people to higher levels of physical activity. The relationship between self-efficacy and behavior is complex and should be the subject of further research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Self-weighing is consistently associated with more effective weight control. However, patterns show that participants disengage from their weight control behaviors following weight gain. Women with BMIs in the overweight/obese range (N\,=\,50) enrolled in a long-term behavioral weight loss program completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys immediately after their daily weigh-ins. Nightly EMA surveys and self-monitoring data through Fitbit measured their weight control behavior that day. On days when participants gained weight (vs. lost or maintained), they reported more negative mood, more guilt/shame, and lower confidence in weight control. Motivation following daily weight gain depended on participants’ overall satisfaction with their weight loss so far: more satisfied participants had marginally higher, but less satisfied participants had marginally lower motivation in response to daily weight gain. Greater guilt/shame and lower motivation after the weigh-in predicted less effective weight control behavior that day (e.g., lower likelihood of calorie tracking, fewer minutes of physical activity). Results demonstrate that even small weight gain is distressing and demoralizing for women in BWL programs, which can lead to goal disengagement. These findings have implications for future BWL interventions, including the potential utility of just-in-time adaptive interventions to promote more adaptive responses in the moments after weigh-ins.},

Eighty undergraduate participants were administered personality trait inventories, then 40 dyads were video recorded doing collaborative tasks. These video recordings were coded for moment-to-moment communion and agency using Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics. Actor-Partner Interdependence Modeling was used to understand the impact of personality traits on interpersonal dynamics (average, variability, slope, complementarity on agency and communion). The results showed that there were no relationships between personality traits and dynamics. There were two main limitations that may explain these results. First, behavior may have been influenced more by social norms to be friendly and take turns than personality traits, especially in this “strong situation”. Second, it may be useful to aggregate behavior over multiple situations to capture variance attributable to traits. Future studies should aggregate behavior over multiple situations and/or change the situational constraints on behavior in order to determine the relationship between states and traits.},

Actor-Partner Interdependence Models were used to examine the relationships between interpersonal behavior and the traits of negative emotionality, positive emotionality, and constraint. Results suggested personality traits were associated with behaviors of both the actor and partner, with the strongest positive relationships found between positive emotionality and warm behavior and between negative emotionality and cold behavior. These results provide evidence that personality traits are related to momentary behaviors in romantic couples.},

  abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The cross-sectional correlation is frequently used to summarize psychological data, and can be considered the basis for many statistical techniques. However, the work of Peter Molenaar on ergodicity has raised concerns about the meaning and utility of this measure, especially when the interest is in discovering general laws that apply to (all) individuals. Through using Cattell’s databox and adopting a multilevel perspective, this paper provides a closer look at the cross-sectional correlation, with the goal to better understand its meaning when ergodicity is absent. An analytical expression is presented that shows the cross-sectional correlation is a function of the between-person correlation (based on person-specific means), and the within-person correlation (based on individuals’ temporal deviations from their person-specific means). Two curiosities related to this expression of the cross-sectional correlation are elaborated on, that is: a) the difference between the within-person correlation and the (average) person-specific correlation; and b) the unexpected scenarios that can arise because the cross-sectional correlation is a weighted sum rather than a weighted average of the between-person and within-person correlations. Seven specific examples are presented to illustrate various ways in which these two curiosities may combine; R code is provided, which allows researchers to investigate additional scenarios.},

Researchers have argued for a broader conceptualization, precision health. Precision health is an ambitious conceptualization of health, which includes dynamic linkages between research and practice as well as medicine, population health, and public health. The goal is a unified approach to match a full range of promotion, prevention, diagnostic, and treatment interventions to fundamental and actionable determinants of health; to not just address symptoms, but to directly target genetic, biological, environmental, and social and behavioral determinants of health.                                         Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the role of social and behavioral sciences within precision health.                                         Main body               Recent technologies, research frameworks, and methods are enabling new approaches to measure, intervene, and conduct social and behavioral science research. These approaches support three opportunities in precision health that the social and behavioral sciences could colead including: (a) developing interventions that continuously “tune” to each person’s evolving needs; (b) enhancing and accelerating links between research and practice; and (c) studying mechanisms of change in real-world contexts. There are three challenges for precision health: (a) methods of knowledge organization and curation; (b) ethical conduct of research; and (c) equitable implementation of precision health.                                         Conclusions               Precision health requires active coleadership from social and behavioral scientists. Prior work and evidence firmly demonstrate why the social and behavioral sciences should colead with regard to three opportunity and three challenge areas.},

We interviewed 80 married men with prostate cancer shortly after treatment, 2 months later, and 8 months later. Social control was distinct from social support and social conflict. There was no evidence that spouse social control was effective in producing positive changes in health behavior. In fact, health-restorative and health-compromising social control were associated with poorhealth behavior. There were no relations between social control and changes in health behavior over time. Spouse social control was associated with greater psychological distress, especially health-restorative and health-compromising social control. There was some evidence that social control undermined personal control beliefs over time. Future research should consider examining differences in the way that social control is conveyed, so that we may better understand its relations to health behavior and well-being.},

  abstract = {Social relationships are adaptive and crucial for survival. This review presents existing evidence indicating that our social connections to others have powerful influences on health and longevity and that lacking social connection qualifies as a risk factor for premature mortality. A systems perspective is presented as a framework by which to move social connection into the realm of public health. Individuals, and health-relevant biological processes, exist within larger social contexts including the family, neighborhood and community, and society and culture. Applying the social ecological model, this review highlights the interrelationships of individuals within groups in terms of understanding both the causal mechanisms by which social connection influences physical health and the ways in which this influence can inform potential intervention strategies. A systems approach also helps identify gaps in our current understanding that may guide future research.},

Results : One partner's health behavior prior to marriage was associated with the other partner's health behavior over time. This was true for positive and negative behaviors for both men and women. Conclusions : Understanding how partners influence each other's health behaviors is important for health promotion and intervention efforts. Targeting the couple for health promotion activities could benefit the couple more than simply targeting individuals.},

  abstract = {Advances in methods for longitudinal data collection and analysis have prompted a surge of research on psychological processes. However, decisions about how to time assessments are often not explicitly tethered to theories about psychological processes but are instead justified on methodological (e.g., power) or practical (e.g., feasibility) grounds. In many cases, methodological decisions are not explicitly justified at all. The disconnect between theories about processes and the timing of assessments in longitudinal research has contributed to misspecified models, interpretive errors, mixed findings, and nonspecific conclusions. In this article, we argue that higher demands should be placed on researchers to connect theories to methods in longitudinal research. We review instances of this disconnect and offer potential solutions as they pertain to four general questions for longitudinal researchers: how time should be scaled, how many assessments are needed, how frequently assessments should occur, and when assessments should happen.},

  abstract = {Clinical and basic personality psychologists interact less than they should, given their similar interests. In clinical personality psychology, available evidence supports a transition from the current categorical system to a hierarchical trait scheme for diagnosing the stable features of personality disorder. However, trait models do not capture the dynamic aspects of personality disorders as they have been described in the clinical literature, and thus miss a clinically critical feature of personality pathology. In contrast, basic personality psychologists have coalesced around a consensual structure of individual differences and become increasingly interested in the dynamic processes that underlie and contextualize traits. But trait psychology models are not sufficiently specific to characterize dynamic personality processes. In this paper, I filter clinical descriptions of personality disorders through the lens of interpersonal theory to specify a recursive within–situation interpersonal pattern of motives, affects, behaviours, and perceptions that could contribute to the stable between–situation patterns of maladaptive behaviour of historical interest to both basic and clinical personality psychologists. I suggest that this interpersonal model adds specificity to recent proposals regarding processes in the basic personality literature and has significant potential to advance research on personality dynamics. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

This method has significant promise for assessing dynamic interpersonal processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of individual sex, dyadic familiarity, and situational conflict on patterns of interpersonal warmth, dominance, and complementarity as assessed via CAID. We used six samples with 603 dyads, including two samples of unacquainted mixed-sex undergraduates interacting in a collaborative task, two samples of couples interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks, and two samples of mothers and children interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks. Complementarity effects were robust across all samples, and individuals tended to be relatively warm and dominant. Results from multilevel models indicated that women were slightly warmer than men, whereas there were no sex differences in dominance. Unfamiliar dyads and dyads interacting in more collaborative tasks were relatively warmer, more submissive, and more complementary on warmth but less complementary on dominance. These findings speak to the utility of the CAID method for assessing interpersonal dynamics and provide norms for researchers who use the method for different types of samples and applications.},

  abstract = {Objective: Despite growing appreciation of how close relationships affect health outcomes, there remains a need to explicate the influence romantic partners have on health behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate how an established model of behavior change—the theory of planned behavior (TPB)— can be extended from an individual level to a dyadic (couple) model to test the influence that relationship partners have on a key determinant of health behavior— behavioral intentions. Methods: Two hundred romantic couples (400 individuals) completed TPB measures regarding physical activity for themselves and their romantic partner as well as a measure of relationship quality. Results: Above and beyond the individuallevel TPB predictors of behavioral intentions (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control), the romantic partner’s perceived behavioral control (PBC) regarding physical activity predicted each individual’s behavioral intentions and moderated the influence of each individual’s PBC on his or her own behavioral intentions. Additionally, the romantic partner’s perceptions of each individual’s TPB measures predicted each individual’s behavioral intentions to be physically active. Quality of the relationship also moderated some partner influences on individuals’ intentions. Conclusions: This paper provides a roadmap for integrating a dyadic framework into individual-level models of behavior change. The findings suggest that data from both partners and relationship quality are important to consider when trying to understand and change health-related behavior such as physical activity. The results broaden the potential applications of the TPB as well as our understanding of how romantic partners might influence important health-related practices.},

We propose that when performing physical activity within interpersonal environments, individuals may adopt acquisitive-agentic, acquisitive-communal, protective-agentic, and/or protective-communal motives. Theory-derived predictors of these motives, implications of motive endorsement, and possible moderators of the effects of motive adoption on physical activity outcomes are discussed.},

PURPOSE: This study investigated (a) the degree to which two classes of social control strategies that romantic partners can use to improve their partners' eating behavior (autonomy-supportive and autonomy-limiting strategies) are associated with eating and relational behaviors, and (b) whether perceptions of the partner's motivation for using social control moderate associations between its use and an individual's eating and relational behavior. METHODS: This study had a daily diary design. One hundred and forty-seven individuals in romantic relationships completed surveys for 14 consecutive days. RESULTS: On days when individuals reported that their partner used autonomy-supportive social control strategies, individuals reported healthier eating and more constructive relational behaviors. There were no effects of autonomy-limiting strategies on eating or relational behavior. Perceptions of a partner's motives did not moderate associations between reported social control and any behavioral outcomes. Moreover, there were no effects of either reported social control strategies or partner motive perceptions across time.

  abstract = {This study is an examination of the effects of living alone on mental health, mental well-being, and maladaptive behaviors. The findings may be summarized in three basic points. First, there is no evidence that persons who live alone are selected into that living arrangement because of preexisting psychological problems, noxious personality characteristics, or incompetent socioeconomic behavior. Second, contrary to what would be predicted by structural functionalism or symbolic interactionism, the data analysis in this study shows that unmarried persons who live alone are in no worse, and on some indicators are in better, mental health than unmarried persons who live with others. Furthermore, divorced and never-married persons who live alone have more in common with married persons, in terms of their mental health characteristics, than do such persons who live with others. Third, unmarried persons who live alone show a slight tendency to be more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors such as drug and alcohol use than are unmarried persons who live with others. These findings have implications for our thinking about the effects of social integration on mental health; the results raise the posibility that socially integrated relationships which provide not only (1) direct social rewards through reinforcement and increased meaning in life but also (2) regulation of behavior through mechanisms of social constraint, obligation, and responsibility, may entail not only rewards but also costs. For persons who live in socially integrated relationships, if the decrements to mental health produced by social regulation are not balanced by social rewards through some as yet unknown process, such social integration may help create psychological distress.}

RSA is increasingly applied in the personality and social psychological literature, but the validity of published results has been challenged by some persistent oversimplifications and misconceptions. Here, we describe the mathematical fundamentals required to interpret RSA results, and we provide a checklist for correctly identifying congruence effects. We clarify two prominent fallacies by showing that the test of a single RSA parameter cannot indicate a congruence effect, and when there is a congruence effect, RSA cannot indicate whether a predictor mismatch in one direction (e.g., overestimation of one’s intelligence) is better or worse than a mismatch in the other direction (underestimation). We hope that this contribution will further enhance the validity and strength of empirical studies that apply this powerful approach.},

  abstract = {Due to the personal and relationship costs associated with attachment anxiety, there has been substantial interest in identifying factors that reduce attachment anxiety over time and buffer attachment anxiety in the moment. We integrated the Attachment Security Enhancement Model (ASEM) and the dependency paradox based in attachment theory to derive novel predictions about how perceived partner support predicts attachment anxiety prospectively (one year later) and concurrently. Newlyweds (N = 326) reported their perceptions that their partners support their personal goals (i.e., perceived support for independence needs) and their perceptions that their partners provide reassurance/responsiveness (i.e., perceived support for dependence needs). We found that greater perceived support for personal goals predicted decreases in attachment anxiety over one year only among people who also perceived high partner reassurance/responsiveness, consistent with the idea that support for independence is most effective when partners also support dependence needs. We also observed evidence that this pattern was most pronounced among people with higher attachment anxiety. Regarding concurrent links, we found that perceiving greater partner reassurance/responsiveness predicted lower concurrent attachment anxiety, whereas perceived support for independent goals did not. Together, these findings extend the ASEM by highlighting that attachment anxiety declines over time when partners are perceived to support one’s needs for independence and dependence simultaneously.},

WTT proposes that the explanatory side of traits consists of social-cognitive mechanisms. These two parts of traits should be recognized as distinct entities that are nevertheless joined into whole traits. This review provides an overview of WTT, discusses new directions for considering WTT in personality development, the possible application of WTT to non-Big 5 traits, and possibilities for interventions based on insights from WTT.},

We describe the process we followed to share our data for a speed-dating article we recently published in Psychological Science (Joel, Eastwick, \& Finkel, 2017) and provide a summary of the issues we considered and addressed along the way. As we drafted the present article, the third author became unsure, in retrospect, about some of the procedures we had followed, especially if our approach were to be perceived as a model for open-data decisions in other, more typical cases involving nonindependent data. This article addresses these concerns, but also identifies areas of consensus. All three authors agree that there remains an unmet need for guidelines and other resources to help researchers address the challenges of sharing data that cover sensitive topics, particularly nonindependent data collected from pairs and groups (e.g., romantic couples, work teams, therapy groups). We conclude with a discussion of new tools that could be developed to help scholars who have collected such data to increase the transparency of their research while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of the participants.},

In a random sample of the general population in northern Germany aged 18–64, BRFs and mental disorders had been assessed in 1996–1997 by the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview. A sum score including eight ranks of the behavior-related health risk factors was built. Death and its causes were ascertained 2017–2018 using residents’ registration files and death certificates. Relations of the sum score and combinations of the BRFs at baseline with all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality 20~years later were analyzed. The sum score and combinations predicted all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. The odds ratio of the sum score was 1.38 (95\% confidence interval 1.31–1.46) after adjustment for age, gender, and mental disorder. In addition to the BRFs, mood, anxiety or somatoform disorders were not related to mortality. We concluded that the sum score and combinations of behavior-related health risk factors predicted mortality, even after adjustment for mental disorders.},

Most health behaviour theories focus on intrapersonal factors and may not adequately account for interpersonal influences. We evaluate a dyadic extension of the Theory of Planned Behaviour by examining whether parent and adolescent characteristics (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions) are associated with not only their own, but also each other’s intentions/behaviours. Design: Using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, we analyse responses from 1,717 parent-adolescent dyads from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study. Main Outcome Measures: Adolescents/parents completed self-reports of their fruit and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviours. Results: Parent/adolescent characteristics are associated with each other’s health-relevant intentions/behaviours above the effects of individuals’ own characteristics on their own behaviours. Parent/adolescent characteristics covary with each other’s outcomes with similar strength, but parent characteristics more strongly relate to adolescent intentions, whereas adolescent characteristics more strongly relate to parent behaviours. Conclusions: Parents and adolescents may bidirectionally influence each other’s health intentions/behaviours. This highlights the importance of dyadic models of health behaviour and suggests intervention targets.},

Our findings tell two stories: First, extracted treatment effects are generally positive but highly variable (M = .173; SD = .195), indicating some interventions impact behavior. However, after adjusting for publication bias, the mean posterior 25 effect pooling domains and interventions is .063 (95\% credible interval .044 to .08, BF10 = 139.8) with substantial unexplained heterogeneity (τ̂ = .129).

In couples, however, the partner is likely to play an important role in planning. This study tested the effects of individual and dyadic planning on goal progress and goal-related actions. Two samples of couples ( N = 76 and N = 87) completed daily diaries over a period of 28 and 21 days. The results indicate that individual and dyadic planning fluctuate on a daily basis and support the idea that dyadic planning is predominantly used as a complementary strategy to individual planning. As expected, individual and dyadic planning were positively associated with higher levels of action control\,and goal progress. In Sample 2, dyadic planning was only associated with goal progress on days in which individuals felt that they were dependent upon their partners’ behaviors to achieve their goals.},

  abstract = {Gesundheitsverhaltensweisen wie regelmäßiger Obst- und Gemüsekonsum oder körperliche Aktivität gehen mit einem reduziertem Risiko für Erkrankungen und allgemeiner Mortalität einher. Trotz der Wichtigkeit, diese Gesundheitsverhaltensweisen regelmäßig auszuführen, erfüllt die Mehrheit der Erwachsenen in Deutschland nicht die Empfehlungen der Weltgesundheitsorganisation. Bisherige Forschung zeigte, dass viele Personen die Absicht haben, entsprechende Gesundheitsverhaltensweisen auszuüben, diese aber oftmals nicht in Handlungen umsetzen (Intentions-Verhaltens-Lücke). In Theorien zu Prozessen der Gesundheitsverhaltensänderung wird angenommen, dass die individuelle Planung von Gesundheitsverhalten eine wichtige Strategie sein kann, um die Intentions-Verhaltens-Lücke zu schließen. Individuelle Planung beinhaltet das konkrete Aufstellen von wann-wo-wie Plänen, um ein Gesundheitsverhalten zu steigern. Es sollte außerdem berücksichtigt werden, dass unsere Gesundheitsregulation stark von unserem sozialen Umfeld beeinflusst wird und Pläne auch zusammen mit einer weiteren Person aufgestellt werden. Dies wird durch das Konzept der dyadischen Planung adressiert, bei der eine Person ihr Gesundheitsverhalten gemeinsam mit einer weiteren Person plant. Um einen Beitrag zur weiteren Erforschung der individuellen und dyadischen Planung von Gesundheitsverhalten zu leisten, widmet sich diese Dissertation fünf Forschungsfragen, welche mithilfe von Daten aus drei Studienprojekten beantwortet werden. Dabei werden die folgenden drei Gesundheitsbereiche untersucht: der Rehabilitationsprozess von Prostatakrebspatienten und ihren Partnerinnen, der Obst- und Gemüsekonsum von erwachsenen Personen, sowie die körperliche Aktivität von erwachsenen, gesunden Paaren. Anhand der Ergebnisse der empirischen Kapitel können die Forschungsfragen zusammengefasst wie folgt beantwortet werden: 1\textbackslash. Das individuelle Planen von Gesundheitsverhalten wurde häufiger angewendet als das dyadische Planen. 2\textbackslash. Als wichtige Prädiktoren der dyadischen Planung von Beckenbodentraining zeigt sich: der positive Affekt, die Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, die Beziehungsqualität sowie der Schweregrad der Inkontinenz des Patienten. 3\textbackslash. Individuelle Planung war ein kontinuierlich positiver Prädiktor für die Ausübung von Beckenbodentraining. Dahingegen war die dyadische Planung nur in späteren Phasen der Rehabilitation mit dem Beckenbodentraining assoziiert. 4\textbackslash. Es zeigte sich, dass die gesteigerte Intention nach der individuellen Planungsintervention der wichtigste Prädiktor für den Obst- und Gemüsekonsum von Personen war. 5\textbackslash. Sowohl für individuelle als auch für dyadische Pläne zeigte sich, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Planumsetzung höher für zuerst aufgestellte Pläne war, wenn Pläne eine Routine enthielten und der geplante Zeitpunkt/Zeitraum weniger spezifisch formuliert war. Zudem wurden dyadische Pläne häufiger als individuelle Pläne umgesetzt. In der allgemeinen Diskussion werden diese Ergebnisse den Ergebnissen der Literatur gegenübergestellt und Implikationen für Forschung und Praxis abgeleitet. Zusammenfassend lässt sich festhalten, dass diese Dissertation einen substanziellen Beitrag für die Literatur zur dyadischen Planung leistet und mehrere Facetten der dyadischen Planung beleuchtet.},

  abstract = {Two studies explored whether dispositional reactance moderates the effects of thought suppression. In Study 1 (N= 87) and Study 2 (N = 114), higher and lower reactant undergraduates were instructed either to suppress or to express their own intrusive thoughts during a stream-of-consciousness writing task. Results revealed that among higher reactant participants, those in the suppression group subsequently reported feeling more out of control of and disturbed by their intrusive thoughts and by their thoughts in general than did those in the expression group. Among the lower reactant participants, this pattern was reversed: Those in the expression group reported feeling more out of control of their thoughts than did those in the suppression group. The findings suggest that being motivated to restore one's freedom may paradoxically leave one feeling more out of control of one's thoughts after suppressing them.},

  abstract = {Relational uncertainty refers to the questions people have about their perceptions of involvement within close relationships. To complement a wealth of research examining the link between relational uncertainty and people’s self-reported communication strategies, we investigate relational uncertainty as a predictor of behavioral sequences within interaction. We draw on both seminal and contemporary theorizing to hypothesize that relational uncertainty impedes dyadic synchrony, or the coordination between partners within interaction. Couples ( N = 97) participated in a 5-minute discussion designed to facilitate expressions of intimacy; we coded these interactions using the circumplex-based Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) model. We evaluated whether couples experiencing relational uncertainty exhibit forms of dyadic asynchrony in which self-disclosure and validation are met by a partner’s hostility. Sequential analyses revealed that, after covarying relationship quality, relationship uncertainty was associated with sequences of self-disclosure/hostility among men ( H1), and self uncertainty and relationship uncertainty were associated with sequences of validation/hostility among both men and women ( H2). Partner uncertainty did not predict dyadic asynchrony in either form. These findings advance scholarship on relational uncertainty by underscoring the importance of sequential exchanges within couple interaction.},

Associated findings, however, are inconsistent. In this study we investigated the role of relationship satisfaction as a moderator of associations of received spousal control with health behavior and affect. In a study with five waves of assessment spanning two weeks to one year following radical prostatectomy (RP), N=109 married or cohabiting prostate-cancer patients repeatedly reported on their pelvic-floor exercise (PFE) to control postsurgery urinary incontinence and affect as primary outcomes, on received PFE-specific spousal control, relationship satisfaction, and covariates. Findings from two-level hierarchical linear models with repeated assessments nested in individuals suggested significant interactions of received spousal control with relationship satisfaction predicting patients' concurrent PFE and positive affect. Patients who were happy with their relationships seemed to benefit from spousal control regarding regular PFE postsurgery while patients less satisfied with their relationships did not. In addition, the latter reported lower levels of positive affect when receiving much spousal control. Results indicate the utility of the inclusion of relationship satisfaction as a moderator of the dual-effects model of social control.},

Modified Poisson regression was specified to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for the associations between baseline social isolation, baseline loneliness, and consistent weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, consistent five daily fruit and vegetable servings, daily alcohol drinking at any time point, smoking at any time point, and a consistently overweight/obese body mass index over the follow-up (all yes vs. no). Models were population weighted and adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health indicators, and depressive symptoms, with mutual adjustment for social isolation and loneliness.Socially isolated participants were less likely than non-isolated participants to consistently report weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (RR = 0.86; 0.77–0.97) or five daily fruit and vegetable servings (RR = 0.81; 0.63–1.04). They were less likely to be consistently overweight or obese (RR = 0.86; 0.77–0.97) and more likely to smoke at any time point (RR = 1.46; 1.17–1.82). Loneliness was not associated with health behaviors or body mass index in adjusted models. Among smokers, loneliness was negatively associated with successful smoking cessation over the follow-up (RR = 0.31; 0.11–0.90).Social isolation was associated with a range of health-related behaviors, and loneliness was associated with smoking cessation over a 10 year follow-up in older English adults.},

  abstract = {Physical activity is essential for health and wellbeing. However, many individuals fail to reach the recommended levels and obesity rates are increasing. Health-related social control refers to strategies employed by 1 person (agent) to influence another person’s (target) health behavior. These strategies can be classified into persuasion (eg, encouraging or motivating) or pressure (eg, nagging or coercing). However, much of the existing research is cross-sectional and mostly focuses on the experiences of the targets.This study investigates how persuasion and pressure within overweight romantic couples relate to outcomes in both agents and targets. Specifically, it examines same-day associations with positive and negative affect, as well as physical activity.This study is a secondary analysis of the 14-day follow-up period from a randomized controlled trial. Accelerometers and daily diaries tracked 99 overweight romantic couples. For each outcome and each partner, separate multilevel models were fitted.Daily persuasion used by agents was associated with increased physical activity in targets and a more favorable affect in agents. Daily pressure was not associated with the physical activity of either partner but was linked to a more unfavorable affect in the agent. Both persuasion and pressure were unrelated to the targets’ affect.Health-related social control in romantic relationships relates to same-day outcomes of both agents and targets. Our findings suggest that health behavior change interventions and weight loss programs could benefit from encouraging persuasion and limiting pressure.Physical activity is essential for health and wellbeing, yet many people struggle to be active enough. In romantic relationships, partners sometimes try to influence each other to be more active. This is known as social control and involves attempts to regulate the other person’s behavior, for example by trying to persuade the other or by using pressure. Research shows that using persuasion can help the other partner to be more physically active, while pressure is often ineffective and can leave them feeling worse. However, little is known about how the partner exerting social control feels or responds in these situations or how social control plays out in daily life. In this study, we followed 99 overweight couples over 2 weeks, using activity trackers and daily questionnaires. We found that on days when 1 partner used more persuasion, the other partner was more physically active, and the persuading partner felt better. In contrast, pressure was unrelated to physical activity, and the partner applying pressure felt worse. These findings suggest that social control is related to both partners’ experiences on the same day. Health promotion programs could leverage the influence of romantic partners by encouraging the use of persuasion while minimizing pressure.},

An important example of such a situation in social psychology is consensus: the fact that people are more similar to each other in certain conditions. Currently, methods to assess differences in consensus (or variability in general) are not very well-developed or widely known. We describe an existing tool that allows testing the extent to which variability depends on one or several predictor variables. We explain how multilevel modelling's capacity to model heterogeneity in residual variance can be used to test substantive hypotheses about differences in variance. We illustrate the procedure and warn against potential misuses of multilevel modelling to analyse differences in variability. We also provide MLwiN and SAS PROC MIXED syntax necessary to run this kind of analyses. In some specific, simple cases, SPSS MIXED can also be used. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Theories of behaviour change and health behaviour change interventions are most often evaluated in between-person designs. However, behaviour change theories apply to individuals not groups and behavioural interventions ultimately aim to achieve within-person rather than between-group change. Within-person methodology, such as N-of-1 (also known as single case design), can circumvent this issue, though has multiple design-specific challenges. This paper provides a conceptual review of the challenges and potential solutions for undertaking N-of-1 studies in health psychology. Key challenges identified include participant adherence to within-person protocols, carry-over and slow onset effects, suitability of behaviour change techniques for evaluation in N-of-1 experimental studies, optimal allocation sequencing and blinding, calculating power/sample size, and choosing the most suitable analysis approach. Key solutions include involving users in study design, employing recent technologies for unobtrusive data collection and problem solving by design. Within-person designs share common methodological requirements with conventional between-person designs but require specific methodological considerations. N-of-1 evaluation designs are appropriate for many though not all types of interventions. A greater understanding of patterns of behaviours and factors influencing behaviour change at the within-person level is required to progress health psychology into a precision science.

Multilevel path models examined tracking accuracy, projection, and mean-level bias in perceptions of partner health social control attempts, and associations between mean-level bias and daily experiences. Perceptions of provider influence contained significant tracking accuracy, projection, and mean-level accuracy in provider use of social control. Underperceptions of persuasion were associated with negative outcomes for the perceiver and no outcomes for the provider. Overperceptions of persuasion were associated with negative outcomes for providers and marginally higher positive affect for perceivers. Misperceptions of pressure were associated with negative outcomes for both perceivers and providers. Results suggest that social control may have the most benefit and least harm to both partners when people accurately perceive the mean-levels of such influence attempts on their health behaviours.},

  abstract = {Background Social isolation is known to be associated with poorer health amongst adults, including coronary heart disease. It is hypothesized that this association may be mediated by inflammation. There has been little prospective research on the long-term impact of social isolation in childhood on adult health or the pathways which might be involved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social isolation in childhood is associated with increased adult inflammation and the mechanisms involved across the life course. Methods This study used multiply-imputed data on 7462 participants of the National Child Development Study in Great Britain. The association between child social isolation (7–11yrs) and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in middle age (44yrs) was examined. We additionally investigated the role of adult social isolation, psychological distress, health behaviors and socioeconomic factors as potential mediators using path analysis and concurrent measurements made across the life course. Results Socially isolated children had higher levels of C-reactive protein in mid-life (standardized coefficient=0.05, p≤0.001). In addition, children who were socially isolated tended to have lower subsequent educational attainment, be in a less advantaged social class in adulthood, were more likely to be psychologically distressed across adulthood and were more likely to be obese and to smoke. All of these factors partially explained the association between childhood social isolation and CRP. However, this association remained statistically significant after considering all mediators simultaneously. Conclusions Social isolation in childhood is associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein in mid-life. This is explained in part through complex mechanisms acting across the life course. Identification and interventions targeted toward socially isolated children may help reduce long-term adult health risk.},

  abstract = {Sedentary lifestyle and overweight are major public health, clinical, and economical problems in modern societies. The worldwide epidemic of excess weight is due to imbalance between physical activity and dietary energy intake. Sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and consequent overweight and obesity markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Regular physical activity 45–60 min per day prevents unhealthy weight gain and obesity, whereas sedentary behaviors such as watching television promote them. Regular exercise can markedly reduce body weight and fat mass without dietary caloric restriction in overweight individuals. An increase in total energy expenditure appears to be the most important determinant of successful exercise-induced weight loss. The best long-term results may be achieved when physical activity produces an energy expenditure of at least 2,500 kcal/week. Yet, the optimal approach in weight reduction programs appears to be a combination of regular physical activity and caloric restriction. A minimum of 60 min, but most likely 80–90 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per day may be needed to avoid or limit weight regain in formerly overweight or obese individuals. Regular moderate intensity physical activity, a healthy diet, and avoiding unhealthy weight gain are effective and safe ways to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases and to reduce premature mortality in all population groups. Although the efforts to promote cardiovascular health concern the whole population, particular attention should be paid to individuals who are physically inactive, have unhealthy diets or are prone to weight gain. They have the highest risk for worsening of the cardiovascular risk factor profile and for cardiovascular disease. To combat the epidemic of overweight and to improve cardiovascular health at a population level, it is important to develop strategies to increase habitual physical activity and to prevent overweight and obesity in collaboration with communities, families, schools, work sites, health care professionals, media and policymakers.},

Kenny, 1996 ) vorgestellt. Die Modelle, die als Akteur-Partner-Moderator-Modell und Akteur-Partner-Mediator-Modell bezeichnet werden, dienen im Rahmen von dyadischen Untersuchungen der Überprüfung von Drittvariablen, welche die Zusammenhänge zwischen abhängigen und unabhängigen Variablen moderieren bzw. mediieren. Neben einer Anleitung zur Analyse des Moderatormodells mittels Regressionsanalysen finden sich Hinweise zur Durchführung von Bootstrap-Analysen bei Verwendung von Strukturgleichungsanalysen. Zur Einschätzung der Mediation werden verschiedene Indikatoren erörtert. Beide Modelle werden anhand von Daten zu Alltagsstress, Partnerschaftsqualität, Depressivität und sexuellen Störungen bei 198 Paaren illustriert. Die zum Akteur-Partner-Moderator-Modell durchgeführten Regressions- und Bootstrap-Analysen stützen die Hypothese, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Alltagsstress und sexuellen Störungen durch die Partnerschaftsqualität moderiert wird. Die auf dem Akteur-Partner-Mediator-Modell basierenden strukturanalytischen Ergebnisse stützen die Annahme, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Alltagsstress und Partnerschaftsqualität durch die Depressivität mediiert wird. Abschließend werden neben dem Nutzen die Vorzüge und Grenzen dieser Modelle diskutiert.},

  abstract = {Smoking is a leading cause of premature death and health inequities in the United States.We estimated cross-sectional prevalence of smoking cessation indicators among US adult recent smokers (n\,=\,43~602) overall and by sociodemographic subgroups in the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 timepoints. Respondents reported past-year quit smoking interest, attempts, sustained (successful) cessation for 6 or more months and use of e-cigarettes or behavioral or pharmacological cessation treatments to quit smoking.Past-year quit smoking attempts declined slightly from 2014-2015 (52.9\%) to 2018-2019 (51.3\%) overall. Quit interest (pooled\,=\,77.1\%) and sustained cessation (pooled\,=\,7.5\%) did not change across timepoints. Among smokers making past-year quit attempts, 34.4\% reported using cessation treatments in 2018-2019, and using e-cigarettes to quit smoking declined from 2014-2015 (33.3\%) to 2018-2019 (25.0\%). Several non-White (vs White) racial and ethnic groups had higher prevalence of quit interest and attempts but lower prevalence of sustained cessation or using e-cigarettes or treatments to quit. Income, education, employment, and metropolitan residence were positively associated with sustained cessation. Sociodemographic inequalities in sustained cessation and most other outcomes did not change across timepoints.Although about half of US adult smokers made past-year quit attempts from 2014 to 2019, only 7.5\% reported sustained cessation, and most who made quit attempts did not report using cessation treatments. Sociodemographic inequalities in cessation were pervasive and not entirely correspondent with sociodemographic variation in motivation to quit. Smoking cessation prevalence and inequalities did not improve from 2014 to 2019. Encouraging quit attempts and equitable access to smoking cessation aids are public health priorities.},

This model suggests health behavior characteristics, including type, frequency, and severity of consequences, are social control antecedents. Social control is then thought to elicit better health behavior and emotions. Attributions to explain social control are proposed to effect emotional reactions and behavior. Undergraduates read hypothetical scenarios to test the proposed model. Study 1 found that health-compromising behaviors and behaviors with more severe consequences elicited more social control. Study 2 found that, compared to negative tactics, positive social control tactics elicited more behavior change, and compared to social/appearance concerns, attributions to health elicited positive emotions. Attributions did not moderate the impact of social control on emotions or behavior.},

Results did not support this conceptualization or assessment of health-related social control in marriage. Based on these results, Study 2 collected qualitative data from husbands and wives via focus groups to explore the use of social control tactics that couples use to change health behavior. Results indicated that many tactics reported by spouses are not contained in the social influence literature, and that the exercise of social control in marriage may best be characterized of as an interdependent communally oriented process between spouses. Using another sample of 109 married couples, Study 3 tested the reliability and validity of a measure developed from the qualitative data. Results indicated the new measure of health-related social control tactics evidenced better reliability and validity than the measure used in Study 1.},

The present study combined qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the experience of health-related social control and relationship processes among a sample of 60 gay male couples. Couples completed semistructured interviews and separate self-administered questionnaires. Findings suggest that partners attempt to change a variety of behaviors, many of which are not HIV related, that they use a variety of social control tactics, some of which are specific to HIV prevention, and that their care and concern for each other and their relationship motivate social control to change health behaviors. The implications for health behavior change research and intervention are discussed.}

Setting and participants The Nurses’ Health Study (1980-2014; n=73 196) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014; n=38 366). Main exposures Five low risk lifestyle factors: never smoking, body mass index 18.5-24.9, moderate to vigorous physical activity (≥30 minutes/day), moderate alcohol intake (women: 5-15 g/day; men 5-30 g/day), and a higher diet quality score (upper 40\%). Main outcome Life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Results The life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer at age 50 was 23.7 years (95\% confidence interval 22.6 to 24.7) for women who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors, in contrast to 34.4 years (33.1 to 35.5) for women who adopted four or five low risk factors. At age 50, the life expectancy free of any of these chronic diseases was 23.5 (22.3 to 24.7) years among men who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors and 31.1 (29.5 to 32.5) years in men who adopted four or five low risk lifestyle factors. For current male smokers who smoked heavily (≥15 cigarettes/day) or obese men and women (body mass index ≥30), their disease-free life expectancies accounted for the lowest proportion (≤75\%) of total life expectancy at age 50. Conclusion Adherence to a healthy lifestyle at mid-life is associated with a longer life expectancy free of major chronic diseases.},

  abstract = {The influence that significant others in social networks could have on chronic kidney disease patients’ health-promoting lifestyles is far-reaching. Although studies have indicated that patients and significant others who have close relationships and share illness appraisals could benefit from communication and cooperation in implementing health-promoting lifestyles, few studies have concentrated on chronic kidney diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of illness appraisal and relationship quality on health-promoting lifestyles among chronic kidney disease patients and their significant others. Ninety-one chronic kidney disease patient−significant other dyads were included. The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, seven-item Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile−II, and World Health Organization Quality of Life−Taiwanese version were used to assess illness appraisal, relationship quality, health-promoting lifestyle, and quality of life in chronic kidney disease patients and their significant others. An actor−partner interdependence model with the use of multilevel modeling was applied for data analysis. The results suggest that patients had more positive views of chronic kidney disease and perceived better relationship quality than significant others did. Patients and significant others with better relationship quality and more positive illness appraisals had higher levels of their own health-promoting lifestyle (actor effect). However, higher levels of relationship quality, as rated by significant others, were found to be associated with poor health-promoting lifestyles in patients. In conclusion, engaging in health-promoting lifestyles requires efforts from patients and their significant others. The influence of relationship quality, as perceived by significant others should be assessed in the context of the scope of care.},

  abstract = {In order to update and improve available evidence on associations of physical activity (PA) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) by applying meta-analytic random effects modeling to data from prospective cohort studies, using high quality criteria of study selection, we searched the PubMed database from January 1980 to December 2010 for prospective cohort studies of PA and incident CVD, distinguishing occupational PA and leisure time PA, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, respectively. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed English papers with original data, studies with large sample size (n ≥ 1,000) and substantial follow-up (≥5 years), available data on major confounders and on estimates of relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR), with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). We included 21 prospective studies in the overall analysis, with a sample size of more than 650,000 adults who were initially free from CVD, and with some 20,000 incident cases documented during follow-up. Among men, RR of overall CVD in the group with the high level of leisure time PA was 0.76 (95\% CI 0.70–0.82, p {$<$} 0.001), compared to the reference group with low leisure time PA, with obvious dose-response relationship. A similar effect was observed among women (RR = 0.73, 95\% CI 0.68–0.78, p {$<$} 0.001). A strong protective effect of occupational PA was observed for moderate level in both men (RR = 0.89, 95\% CI 0.82–0.97, p = 0.008) and women (RR = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.67–1.03, p = 0.089). No publication bias was observed. Our findings suggest that high level of leisure time PA and moderate level of occupational PA have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health by reducing the overall risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke among men and women by 20 to 30 percent and 10 to 20 percent, respectively. This evidence from high quality studies supports efforts of primary and secondary prevention of CVD in economically advanced as well as in rapidly developing countries.},

Although much is known about the impact of single factors, the current evidence about the combined effects of lifestyle behaviors on mortality has not yet been systematically compiled. Method We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Somed up to February 2012. Prospective studies were selected if they reported the combined effects of at least three of five lifestyle factors (obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and physical activity). The mean effect sizes that certain numbers of combined lifestyle factors have on mortality were compared to the group with the least number of healthy lifestyle factors by meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results 21 studies (18 cohorts) met the inclusion criteria of which 15 were included in the meta-analysis that comprised 531,804 people with a mean follow-up of 13.24years. The relative risks decreased proportionate to a higher number of healthy lifestyle factors for all cause mortality. A combination of at least four healthy lifestyle factors is associated with a reduction of the all cause mortality risk by 66\% (95\% confidence interval 58\%–73\%). Conclusion Adherence to a healthy lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of mortality.},

  abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is a widely used technique for examining reciprocal causal effects using longitudinal data. Critics of the CLPM have noted that by failing to account for certain person-level associations, estimates of these causal effects can be biased. Because of this, models that incorporate stable-trait components (e.g., the random-intercept CLPM) have become popular alternatives. Debates about the merits of the CLPM have continued, however, with some researchers arguing that the CLPM is more appropriate than modern alternatives for examining common psychological questions. In this article, I discuss the ways that these defenses of the CLPM fail to acknowledge well-known limitations of the model. I propose some possible sources of confusion regarding these models and provide alternative ways of thinking about the problems with the CLPM. I then show in simulated data that with realistic assumptions, the CLPM is very likely to find spurious cross-lagged effects when they do not exist and can sometimes underestimate these effects when they do exist.},

  abstract = {Social isolation associated with greater risk for mortality is well documented, however, it is unclear whether and the extent to which social isolation influences mortality through health behaviors. We therefore assessed the mediation between social isolation and mortality by health behaviors. 15,000 adults ages 18–89~years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US (NHANES III) (1988–1994) were followed through 2015. The outcomes of overall and cause-specific mortality were assessed by linking with the National Death Index. Social isolation was based on a modified Social Network Index. Mediation analyses were conducted under the counterfactual framework. Compared with participants who were not socially isolated, those who were isolated had significantly increased risk for overall mortality (HR~=~1.33, 95\% CI: 1.15–1.54), cardiovascular disease (CVD)-specific mortality (HR~=~1.28, 95\% CI: 1.01–1.62) and mortality from causes other than CVD or cancer (HR~=~1.53, 95\% CI: 1.22–1.90). Social isolation was not independently associated with risk for cancer-specific mortality. The association between social isolation and cancer-specific mortality was largely (74\%) mediated by health behaviors, including smoking, physical activity and quality of diet. The associations between social isolation and CVD or other specific mortality were partly (about one-fifth) explained by unhealthy behaviors. In conclusion, the extent to which social isolation and mortality was mediated by healthy behaviors varies by causes of death. Given mounting evidence that social isolation is increasing in society, it is important to add social isolation to the list of public health concerns in addition to conventional risk factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Tobacco smoking remains one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real-time. The social context of smokers has, however, been neglected in smartphone apps promoting smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of a smartphone app in which smokers quit smoking with the help of a social network member.                                         Methods               This protocol describes the design of a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Participants of this study are adult smokers who smoke at least one cigarette per day and intend to quit smoking at a self-set quit date. Blocking as means of group-balanced randomization is used to allocate participants to intervention or control conditions. Both intervention and control group use a smartphone-compatible device for measuring their daily smoking behavior objectively via exhaled carbon monoxide. In addition, the intervention group is instructed to use the SmokeFree Buddy app, a multicomponent app that also facilitates smoking-cessation specific social support from a buddy over a smartphone application. All participants fill out a baseline diary for three consecutive days and are invited to the lab for a background assessment. They subsequently participate in an end-of-day diary phase from 7\,days before and until 20\,days after a self-set quit date. Six months after the self-set quit date a follow-up diary for three consecutive days takes place. The primary outcome measures are daily self-reported and objectively-assessed smoking abstinence and secondary outcome measures are daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked.                                         Discussion               This is the first study examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation mobile intervention using the SmokeFree Buddy app compared to a control group in a real-life setting around a self-set quit date using a portable objective measure to assess smoking abstinence. Opportunities and challenges with running studies with smoking participants and certain design-related decisions are discussed.

  abstract = {Abstract The psychology of close human relationships is increasingly well understood and our understanding of the neurobiology of the onset of pairbonding behaviour in a range of species has benefited from the use of rodent-based models. However, the human literature has suffered from a lack of focus upon the unique nature of primate social bonds and has so far failed to adequately identify the neurobiological and behavioural mechanisms which maintain these complex, diverse and enduring social networks. One neurobiological mechanism that has been overlooked is the endogenous opioid system. Though less explicitly researched than the more familiar oxytocin/vasopressin system, there is considerable evidence that the opioids play a fundamental role in sociality, especially in the primates. This review summarises our current understanding of the evidence for the role of this system in prosocial behaviour in non-primate mammals, nonhuman primates and humans. An important conclusion is that the opioid system may play a more central role in sociality in primates (including humans) than in other mammalian taxa.},

Results of the Monte Carlo simulation indicated that measurement model misspecification can inflate unstandardized structural parameter estimates by as much as 400\% or deflate them by as much as 80\% and lead to Type I or Type II errors of inference, depending on whether the exogenous or the endogenous latent construct is misspecified.

Digital health technologies (DHTs) and digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to shepherd this transformation. Given the proliferation of digital health applications, a scoping review was conducted to map the DHTs and DHIs targeting lifestyle behavior change in Singapore.                                         Methods               A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and clinical trial registries and a manual search of gray literature and mobile app stores were conducted to identify patient-facing IoT (internet of things) technologies (wearables, apps, bots, websites) that target physical activity, diet, tobacco/alcohol use, sleep quality, and/or mindfulness in Singapore from 2013 to 2023.                                         Results               Forty-six DHTs and thirty-five DHIs were identified. Apps were the most common while websites and bots were the least common. Most DHTs and DHIs played monitoring or preventative behavior change functions. Most applications targeted multiple behaviors, with physical activity being the most common and tobacco/alcohol use being the least common. Behavioral change strategies included feedback and monitoring (80\%), goals and planning (70\%), associations (62\%), personalization (59\%), gamification (54\%), rewards (33\%), human coaching (30\%), and just-in-time adaptations (4\%).                                         Conclusion               This review identified gaps in digital health applications that address addictive behaviors and the elderly. Future efforts should prioritize adaptive, personalized technologies based on user-centric designs and robust behavioral frameworks to enhance long-term behavioral change. Insights from Singapore's experience can guide the global development of more effective health-improving digital applications.},

The enabling hypothesis suggests that social support may strengthen women’s behavioral self-efficacy. A three-arm parallel non-randomized controlled trial with 300 women and their social partners experimentally examined whether self-efficacy and social support can enable women’s pelvic-floor-protective behaviors in rural Nepal. Three villages received (1) self-efficacy (2) self-efficacy and social support promotion, or (3) information only control. The coprimary outcomes were reduced weight carried and using protective lifting techniques at 2-month follow-up. Self-efficacy promotion increased the use of protective lifting techniques 9\% more than information only (d = 0.28). Weight was reduced by 3 kg more when additionally promoting social support compared to selfefficacy alone (d = 0.39). Self-efficacy and social support promotion enable women to better protect their pelvic floor health and may complement educational approaches to health behavior change in low-resource populations.},

  abstract = {Background The Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) specifies the potentially active content of behaviour change interventions. Evaluation of BCTTv1 showed the need to extend it into a formal ontology, improve its labels and definitions, add BCTs and subdivide existing BCTs. We aimed to develop a Behaviour Change Technique Ontology (BCTO) that would meet these needs. Methods The BCTO was developed by: (1) collating and synthesising feedback from multiple sources; (2) extracting information from published studies and classification systems; (3) multiple iterations of reviewing and refining entities, and their labels, definitions and relationships; (4) refining the ontology via expert stakeholder review of its comprehensiveness and clarity; (5) testing whether researchers could reliably apply the ontology to identify BCTs in intervention reports; and (6) making it available online and creating a computer-readable version. Results Initially there were 282 proposed changes to BCTTv1. Following first-round review, 19 BCTs were split into two or more BCTs, 27 new BCTs were added and 26 BCTs were moved into a different group, giving 161 BCTs hierarchically organised into 12 logically defined higher-level groups in up to five hierarchical levels. Following expert stakeholder review, the refined ontology had 247 BCTs hierarchically organised into 20 higher-level groups. Independent annotations of intervention evaluation reports by researchers familiar and unfamiliar with the ontology resulted in good levels of inter-rater reliability (0.82 and 0.79, respectively). Following revision informed by this exercise, 34 BCTs were added, resulting in the first published version of the BCTO containing 281 BCTs organised into 20 higher-level groups over five hierarchical levels. Discussion The BCTO provides a standard terminology and comprehensive classification system for the content of behaviour change interventions that can be reliably used to describe interventions. The development and maintenance of an ontology is an iterative and ongoing process; no ontology is ever ‘finished’. The BCTO will continue to evolve and grow (e.g. new BCTs or improved definitions) as a result of user feedback and new available evidence.},

  abstract = {Background Physical activity is critical for the management of knee osteoarthritis, and the spouse may play a role in encouraging or discouraging physical activity. Purpose To examine four types of spousal influence—spouses' daily activity, autonomy support, pressure, and persuasion--on the daily physical activity of adults living with knee osteoarthritis. Methods A total of 141 couples reported their daily experiences for 22 days using a handheld computer, and wore an accelerometer to measure moderate activity and steps. Results Spouses' autonomy support for patient physical activity, as well as their own level of activity, was concurrently associated with patients' greater daily moderate activity and steps. In addition, on days when male patients perceived that spouses exerted more pressure to be active, they spent less time in moderate activity. Conclusions Couple-oriented interventions for knee osteoarthritis should target physical activity in both partners and spousal strategies for helping patients stay active.},

Previous discussions of this discrepancy have considered responsible factors including differences in measurement error and use of nonlinear scales. This article demonstrates that the differential efficiency of experimental and field tests of interactions is also attributable to the differential residual variances of such interactions once the component main effects have been partialed out.The authors derive an expression for this residual variance in terms of the joint distribution of the component variables and explore how properties of the distribution affect the efficiency of tests of moderator effects. The authors show that tests of interactions in field studies will often have less than 20\% of the efficiency of optimal experimental tests and discuss implications for the design of field studies.

This study uses a path analysis to investigate the longitudinal association between loneliness and social isolation with PA using the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Higher levels of social isolation measured using the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index were directly and indirectly associated with lower levels of walking, moderate PA, and vigorous PA over 6 years. Additionally, higher levels of walking were associated with lower levels of loneliness measured using a modified version of the University of California, Los Angeles loneliness scale over a 3-year period. Future interventions should target individuals who are more socially isolated and explore the effects of different types of PA on loneliness over time.},

  abstract = {Significance             Changing individuals’ behavior is key to tackling some of today’s most pressing societal challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change. Choice architecture interventions aim to nudge people toward personally and socially desirable behavior through the design of choice environments. Although increasingly popular, little is known about the overall effectiveness of choice architecture interventions and the conditions under which they facilitate behavior change. Here we quantitatively review over a decade of research, showing that choice architecture interventions successfully promote behavior change across key behavioral domains, populations, and locations. Our findings offer insights into the effects of choice architecture and provide guidelines for behaviorally informed policy making.           ,                             Over the past decade, choice architecture interventions or so-called nudges have received widespread attention from both researchers and policy makers. Built on insights from the behavioral sciences, this class of behavioral interventions focuses on the design of choice environments that facilitate personally and socially desirable decisions without restricting people in their freedom of choice. Drawing on more than 200 studies reporting over 440 effect sizes (               n               = 2,148,439), we present a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across techniques, behavioral domains, and contextual study characteristics. Our results show that choice architecture interventions overall promote behavior change with a small to medium effect size of Cohen’s               d               = 0.43 (95\% CI [0.38, 0.48]). In addition, we find that the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions varies significantly as a function of technique and domain. Across behavioral domains, interventions that target the organization and structure of choice alternatives (decision structure) consistently outperform interventions that focus on the description of alternatives (decision information) or the reinforcement of behavioral intentions (decision assistance). Food choices are particularly responsive to choice architecture interventions, with effect sizes up to 2.5 times larger than those in other behavioral domains. Overall, choice architecture interventions affect behavior relatively independently of contextual study characteristics such as the geographical location or the target population of the intervention. Our analysis further reveals a moderate publication bias toward positive results in the literature. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings for theory and behaviorally informed policy making.},

Unfortunately, poor adherence to behaviors recommended in lifestyle interventions is widespread, particularly over the long term; thus, the “adherence problem” represents a significant challenge to the effectiveness of these interventions. The current review provides an overview of the adherence problem and describes a theoretical framework through which the factors that affect adherence can be understood. To further understand the difficulties individuals face when adhering to health behavior changes, we focus our discussion on the challenges associated with adherence to lifestyle behaviors recommended for weight loss and healthy weight management (ie, reductions in dietary intake and increases in physical activity). We describe strategies that improve long-term adherence to health behaviors related to healthy weight management, including the provision of extended care, skills training, improving social support, and strategies specific to maintaining changes in dietary intake and physical activity. Finally, we discuss difficulties involved in implementing long-term weight management programs and suggest practical solutions for providers.},

It is indicated, however, that the direct consequences of the classical ergodic theorems for psychology and psychometrics invalidate this conjectured generalizability: only under very strict conditions-which are hardly obtained in real psychological processes-can a generalization be made from a structure of interindividual variation to the analogous structure of intraindividual variation. Illustrations of the lack of this generalizability are given in the contexts of psychometrics, developmental psychology, and personality theory.}

  abstract = {Moderator variables are widely hypothesized and studied in the organizational sciences, but the empirical track record of moderator variable studies is very discouraging. These studies often lack sufficient statistical power and the type of designs and measures common in organizational research virtually guarantee that the moderator effects that are found are usually extremely small. We recommend that future attempts to identify and estimate moderator effects should be limited to situations where better measures, stronger research designs and a realistic cost-benefit assessment are available. Researchers should avoid moderator hypotheses in contexts where the measures and research designs employed do not allow them to be tested in a meaningful way, and should be cautious about interpreting the very small effects they are likely to find.},

  abstract = {Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)–suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the individual’s need for support, whenever this need arises. A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely, the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the creation of effective JITAIs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background               During a quit attempt, cues from a smoker’s environment are a major cause of brief smoking lapses, which increase the risk of relapse. Quit Sense is a theory-guided Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention smartphone app, providing smokers with the means to learn about their environmental smoking cues and provides ‘in the moment’ support to help them manage these during a quit attempt.                                         Objective               To undertake a feasibility randomised controlled trial to estimate key parameters to inform a definitive randomised controlled trial of Quit Sense.                                         Design               A parallel, two-arm randomised controlled trial with a qualitative process evaluation and a ‘Study Within A Trial’ evaluating incentives on attrition. The research team were blind to allocation except for the study statistician, database developers and lead researcher. Participants were not blind to allocation.                                         Setting               Online with recruitment, enrolment, randomisation and data collection (excluding manual telephone follow-up) automated through the study website.                                         Participants               Smokers (323 screened, 297 eligible, 209 enrolled) recruited via online adverts on Google search, Facebook and Instagram.                                         Interventions                                Participants were allocated to ‘usual care’ arm (                 n                 \>=\>105; text message referral to the National Health Service SmokeFree website) or ‘usual care’ plus Quit Sense (                 n                 \>=\>104), via a text message invitation to install the Quit Sense app.                                                        Main outcome measures               Follow-up at 6 weeks and 6 months post enrolment was undertaken by automated text messages with an online questionnaire link and, for non-responders, by telephone. Definitive trial progression criteria were met if a priori thresholds were included in or lower than the 95\% confidence interval of the estimate. Measures included health economic and outcome data completion rates (progression criterion \#1 threshold: ≥\,70\%), including biochemical validation rates (progression criterion \#2 threshold: ≥\,70\%), recruitment costs, app installation (progression criterion \#3 threshold: ≥\,70\%) and engagement rates (progression criterion \#4 threshold: ≥\,60\%), biochemically verified 6-month abstinence and hypothesised mechanisms of action and participant views of the app (qualitative).                                         Results               Self-reported smoking outcome completion rates were 77\% (95\% confidence interval 71\% to 82\%) and health economic data (resource use and quality of life) 70\% (95\% CI 64\% to 77\%) at 6 months. Return rate of viable saliva samples for abstinence verification was 39\% (95\% CI 24\% to 54\%). The per-participant recruitment cost was £19.20, which included advert (£5.82) and running costs (£13.38). In the Quit Sense arm, 75\% (95\% CI 67\% to 83\%; 78/104) installed the app and, of these, 100\% set a quit date within the app and 51\% engaged with it for more than 1 week. The rate of 6-month biochemically verified sustained abstinence, which we anticipated would be used as a primary outcome in a future study, was 11.5\% (12/104) in the Quit Sense arm and 2.9\% (3/105) in the usual care arm (estimated effect size: adjusted odds ratio\>=\>4.57, 95\% CIs 1.23 to 16.94). There was no evidence of between-arm differences in hypothesised mechanisms of action. Three out of four progression criteria were met.               The Study Within A Trial analysis found a £20 versus £10 incentive did not significantly increase follow-up rates though reduced the need for manual follow-up and increased response speed. The process evaluation identified several potential pathways to abstinence for Quit Sense, factors which led to disengagement with the app, and app improvement suggestions.                                         Limitations               Biochemical validation rates were lower than anticipated and imbalanced between arms. COVID-19-related restrictions likely limited opportunities for Quit Sense to provide location tailored support.                                         Conclusions               The trial design and procedures demonstrated feasibility and evidence was generated supporting the efficacy potential of Quit Sense.                                         Future work               Progression to a definitive trial is warranted providing improved biochemical validation rates.                                         Trial registration               This trial is registered as ISRCTN12326962.

  abstract = {There is a growing interest among personality psychologists in the processes underlying the social consequences of personality. To adequately tackle this issue, complex designs and sophisticated mathematical models must be employed. In this article, we describe established and novel statistical approaches to examine social consequences of personality for individual, dyadic and group (round–robin and network) data. Our overview includes response surface analysis (RSA), autoregressive path models and latent growth curve models for individual data; actor–partner interdependence models and dyadic RSAs for dyadic data; and social relations and social network analysis for round–robin and network data. Altogether, our goal is to provide an overview of various analytical approaches, the situations in which each can be employed and a first impression about how to interpret their results. Three demo data sets and scripts show how to implement the approaches in R. Copyright © 2015 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Despite evidence of the benefits of physical activity, most individuals with type 2 diabetes do not meet physical activity recommendations. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief intervention targeting self-efficacy and self-regulation to increase physical activity in older adults with type 2 diabetes., Older adults (Mage = 61.8 ± 6.4) with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome were randomized into a titrated physical activity intervention (n = 58) or an online health education course (n = 58). The intervention included walking exercise and theory-based group workshops. Self-efficacy, self-regulation and physical activity were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and a follow-up., Results indicated a group by time effect for self-regulation [F(2,88) = 14.021, p {$<$} .001, η2 = .24] and self-efficacy [F(12,77) = 2.322, p {$<$} .05, η2 = .266] with increases in the intervention group. The intervention resulted in short-term increases in physical activity (d = .76, p {$<$} .01), which were partially maintained at the six-month follow-up (d = .35, p {$<$} .01)., The intervention increased short-term physical activity but was not successful at maintaining increases in physical activity. Similar intervention effects were observed in self-efficacy and self-regulation. Future research warrants adjusting intervention strategies to increase long-term change.},

According to this perspective, people serve as means to goals—helping other people to reach their goals in a variety of ways, such as by contributing their time; lending their knowledge, skills, and resources; and providing emotional support and encouragement. Because people serve as means to goals, we propose that considering relationship processes in terms of the principles of goal pursuit can provide novel and important insights into the ways that people think, feel, and behave in these interpersonal contexts. We describe the principles of means-goals relations, review evidence for each principle involving people as means, and discuss implications of our approach for relationship formation, maintenance, and dissolution.},

Specifically, we test the hypotheses that (a) partners who serve more goals will be evaluated as more interpersonally close, supportive, and responsive than those who serve fewer goals, and (b) partners who serve more goals will be less common in social networks than those who serve fewer goals. Three studies (N = 1,064) found consistent support for these hypotheses while examining relationships with all members of participants’ active social network and their full range of goal pursuits. In addition, we found that the association between number of goals a partner serves and relationship evaluation is stronger for people who perceived their social networks as less (vs. more) instrumental on average, and among people who perceived their relationships as less close, less supportive, and less responsive, on average. Implications for close relationships are discussed.},

Methods Investigators analyzed a sample of U.S. adults aged 18–64 years using data from the 2016–2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey in March 2020. Logistic regression models examined the associations among 3 healthy behaviors (currently not smoking, physical activity, and nonheavy alcohol consumption) and 4 indicators of health-related quality of life (general health, physical health, mental health, and activity limitation). Alpha was set at 0.01. Results A total of 450,870 individuals were included in the analysis (weighted n=100,102,329). Of these, 82.0\% were current nonsmokers, 92.8\% were nonheavy drinkers, and 77.6\% reported physical activity. The prevalence of having none, 1, 2, and 3 of the health behaviors was 0.7\%, 7.7\%, 30.1\%, and 61.5\%, respectively. Smoking status and physical activity status were significantly associated with all the 4 health-related quality of life indicators. Alcohol status was significantly associated with mental health and activity limitation. The associations demonstrated a higher health-related quality of life among individuals who reported healthy behaviors than among those who did not engage in healthy behaviors. Compared with respondents who reported none of the health behaviors, people with all 3 health behaviors were more likely to report higher health-related quality of life. Conclusions Health behaviors were significantly associated with health-related quality of life among U.S. adults. Healthy behaviors should be encouraged because adopting these behaviors may contribute to a higher health-related quality of life.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that the personality of a relationship partner predicts not only the individual’s own satisfaction with the relationship but also the partner’s satisfaction. Based on the actor–partner interdependence model, the present research tested whether actor and partner effects of personality are biased when the same method (e.g., self-report) is used for the assessment of personality and relationship satisfaction and, consequently, shared method variance is not controlled for. Data came from 186 couples, of whom both partners provided self- and partner reports on the Big Five personality traits. Depending on the research design, actor effects were larger than partner effects (when using only self-reports), smaller than partner effects (when using only partner reports), or of about the same size as partner effects (when using self- and partner reports). The findings attest to the importance of controlling for shared method variance in dyadic data analysis.}

  abstract = {Smokers tend to increase their cigarette consumption during angry states. We sought to determine whether increases in post-quit anger symptoms predict relapse among smokers who had received 8-weeks of smoking cessation treatment (21mg nicotine patch+smoking cessation counseling). The 15-item state anger assessment [from Spielberger, C., 1999. STAXI-2: the state trait anger expression inventory professional manual, Odessa, FL] was administered at pre-treatment (2 weeks before the target quit date; TQD) and 1 week after the TQD. Abstinence at 8-weeks post-quit was biochemically verified using carbon monoxide. Smokers who reported increases in pre- to post-quit state anger levels (n=117) were significantly more likely to relapse by 8-weeks after treatment as compared to smokers whose anger did not change or decreased after quitting (n=130) (OR=1.06; CI=1.01–1.10; p=0.01). Furthermore, smokers with increased post-quit anger relapsed almost twice as quickly than those who did not have an increase in post-quit anger symptoms (HR=1.98; CI: 1.32–2.96; p=0.001). These data suggest that anger may be an important withdrawal symptom that influences liability to relapse. Future studies are needed to evaluate treatment strategies that effectively help smokers reduce and manage post-quit anger.},

This project analyzes longitudinal data (≥ two decades) from both partners of up to 3,501 German and 1,842 Australian couples to investigate how couple concordance in life satisfaction, self-rated health, mental health, and physical health might change with transitioning to parenthood and an empty nest. Results revealed couple concordance in intercepts (averaged r = .52), linear trajectories (averaged r = .55), and wave-specific fluctuations around trajectories (averaged r = .21). Concordance in linear trajectories was stronger after transitions (averaged r = .81) than before transitions (averaged r = .43), whereas no systematic transition-related change in concordance of wave-specific fluctuations was found. Findings emphasize that shared transitions represent windows of change capable of sending couples onto mutual upward or downward trajectories in health and well-being.},

Across three daily life studies, we examined whether mixed-gender couples reported more positive relationship functioning on days in which they engaged in more shared problematic behaviors. In two studies (Study 1: 82 couples who smoke; Study 2: 117 couples who are inactive), days of more shared problematic behavior were accompanied by higher daily closeness and relationship satisfaction. A third study with 79 couples post-stroke investigating unhealthy eating failed to provide evidence for symptom-system fit. In exploratory lagged analyses, we found more support for prior-day problematic behavior being associated with next-day daily relationship functioning than vice-versa. Together, findings point to the importance of a systems perspective when studying interpersonal dynamics that might be involved in the maintenance of problematic behaviors.},

Knowledge about the nature and psychosocial correlates of such dyadic covariation could inform important avenues for physical activity promotion.                                         Purpose               The present study investigates hour-by-hour covariation between partners (i.e., synchrony) in MVPA and sedentary behavior as partners engage in their daily lives and links it with person-level MVPA/sedentary behavior, temporal characteristics, and relationship variables.                                         Methods               We used 7-day accelerometer data from two couple studies (Study 1, n = 306 couples, aged 18–80 years; Study 2, n = 108 couples, aged 60–87 years) to estimate dyadic covariation in hourly MVPA and sedentary behavior between partners. Data were analyzed using coordinated multilevel modeling.                                         Results               In both studies, hourly MVPA and sedentary behavior exhibited similarly sized dyadic covariation between partners in the low-to-medium range of effects. Higher MVPA synchrony between partners was linked with higher individual weekly MVPA and higher individual weekly sedentary levels, whereas higher sedentary synchrony between partners was associated with higher individual weekly MVPA but lower individual weekly sedentary levels. MVPA and sedentary synchrony were higher in the morning and evening, more pronounced on weekends, and associated with more time spent together, longer relationship duration, and time-varying perceptions of higher partner closeness.                                         Conclusions               This study demonstrates that MVPA and sedentary behaviors do not occur in a social vacuum. Instead, they are linked with close others such as partners. Thus, capitalizing on social partners may increase the effectiveness of individual-level physical activity interventions.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoke exposure is the main preventable cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow limitation is closely associated with smoking exposure. Smoking could also interfere with lipid metabolism. To determine the respiratory functional and metabolic changes after smoking cessation in smokers in the short term. All patients were current smokers. They were assessed by spirometry and questionnaires such as COPD assessment test(CAT), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) test for dyspnea, Fagestrom’s test for nicotine dependence. Exhaled CO was detected in order to evaluate smoking exposure and smoking cessation (normal value{$<$}7 ppm). A blood sampling was eventually taken for vitamin D and cholesterol assay. All patients underwent therapy with counselling and varenicline as first-line treatment according to its schedule. Detection time: at baseline and one month after smoking cessation. All patients quit smoking during treatment. The mean age was 62 with a prevalence of males. The analysis revealed the following mean values at baseline: CAT mean score was 15, pack-years 35.5, Fagestrom’s Test mean score 5.0. The West’s value was 8.5, whereas Body mass index (BMI) was 25.5.Cigarette daily consumption mean value was 22.5. The comparison before and at follow up one month after smoking cessation about functional and metabolic parameters, show us the following results: FEV 1 was increased by 200 mL (p{$<$}0.02), FEF 25/75 was improved as well as mMRC test. The eCO was dropped to as low as 8 ppM. Interestingly the vitamin D level was increased from 25 to 28 ng/mL without any support therapy. The cholesterol total level was reduced and CAT value and DLCO were also significantly improved. Quit smoking is useful to improve symptoms, respiratory function and metabolic parameters in the short term.},

  abstract = {Close relationships play a vital role in human health, but much remains to be learned about specific mechanisms of action and potential avenues for intervention. This article provides an evaluation of research on close relationships processes relevant to health, drawing on themes from major relationship science theories to present a broad conceptual framework for understanding the interpersonal processes and intrapersonal pathways linking relationships to health and disease outcomes. The analysis reveals that both social connection and social disconnection broadly shape biological responses and behaviors that are consequential for health. Furthermore, emerging work offers insights into the types of social dynamics that are most consequential for health, and the potential pathways through which they operate. Following from this analysis, the authors suggest several research priorities to facilitate the translation of discoveries from relationship science into relationship-based interventions and public health initiatives. These priorities include developing finer grained theoretical models to guide research, the systematic investigation of potential mediating pathways such as dyadic influences on health behavior and physiological coregulation, and taking into account individual differences and contextual factors such as attachment style, gender, socioeconomic status, and culture. In addition, a pressing need exists for laboratory and field research to determine which types of interventions are both practical and effective.

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review our current knowledge of CMB and provide recommendations on how to control it. We organize our review into five main sections. First, we explain the harmful effects of CMB (why it is bad). Second, we discuss the complexity caused by the fact that there are multiple sources of CMB, several of which are likely to be present in any study. Third, we present evidence that the conditions under which CMB is likely to occur are relatively widespread, and fourth, we explain why CMB is not easy to fix. Finally, we identify several avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Low levels of physical activity are implicated in low life expectancies of people receiving maintenance haemodialysis. Accelerometers are increasingly being used to quantify activity behaviours of this population but guidance to quality-assure such data is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide data processing and reduction recommendations to ensure accelerometer-derived outcomes are sufficiently reliable for interpretative analysis.                                         Methods               Seventy people receiving maintenance haemodialysis (age 55.9\,±\,15.7\,years, 34\% women, 23\% diabetic) from a single outpatient renal unit volunteered for the study. Participants wore Actigraph GT3x and ActivPAL monitors during waking hours over seven days. Reliability of accelerometer output (normalised to wear-time) was assessed via intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The Spearman-Brown prophecy formula was subsequently applied to the ICCs to derive the minimum required accelerometer wear-time for each behavioural outcome.                                         Results               Monitor wear compliance was greater on dialysis compared to non-dialysis days (90\% v 77\%). Participants were significantly more active on non-dialysis days compared to dialysis days but there were no significant differences in estimated behaviours between days within the same condition. Average measure ICCs for all accelerometer outcomes were high (range 0.76–0.96). Computations indicated that habitual physical activity and sedentary behaviour could be estimated with a minimum reliability level of 0.80 from one dialysis day and two non-dialysis days, and at least eight hours monitor wear per day. Applying this rubric allowed 90\% of participant data to be retained for further analysis.                                         Conclusions               Regardless of accelerometer, one dialysis and two non-dialysis days data with a minimum of eight hours wear each day should enable habitual activity of people receiving maintenance haemodialysis to be characterised with acceptable reliability. These recommendations reconcile the tension between wear-time criteria stringency and retention of an adequately representative sample.},

  abstract = {Recent theories of stress reactivity posit that, when stressed, individuals tend to seek out opportunities to affiliate with and nurture others in order to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of stress. However, few studies have tested empirically the role of prosocial behavior in reducing negative emotional responses to stress. The current analyses used daily diary data to investigate whether engaging in prosocial behavior buffered the negative effects of naturally-occurring stressors on emotional well-being. Results showed that on a given day, prosocial behavior moderated the effects of stress on positive affect, negative affect, and overall mental health. Findings suggest that affiliative behavior may be an important component of coping with stress, and indicate that engaging in prosocial behavior might be an effective strategy for reducing the impact of stress on emotional functioning.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW—To summarize recent research findings from selected publications focusing on links between social support and physical health. RECENT FINDINGS—Current research is extending our understanding of social support’s influences on health. Many epidemiological studies have concentrated on further linking measures of social support to physical health outcomes. A few studies are now moving into newer areas, such as emphasizing health links to support receipt and provision. Researchers are also interested in outlining relevant pathways, including potential biological (i.e., inflammation) and behavioral (i.e., health behaviors) mechanisms. Interventions attempting to apply basic research on the positive effects of social support are also widespread. Although the longer-term effects of such interventions on physical health remain to be determined, such interventions show promise in influencing the quality of life in many chronic disease populations. SUMMARY—Recent findings often show a robust relationship in which social and emotional support from others can be protective for health. However, the next generation of studies must explain why this relationship exists and the specificity of such links. This research is in its infancy but will be crucial in order to better tailor support interventions that can impact on physical health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objectives. We sought to identify perceived personal barriers to physical activity and examine the potential association between these barriers and sociodemographic and behavioral variables, including participation in leisure-time physical activity. Methods. In 2003, we conducted a population-based study in Pelotas, Brazil. Participants aged 20 years and older were selected according to a multistage sampling strategy. Participants responded to both the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a standardized questionnaire investigating 8 perceived personal barriers. Results. Only 26.8\% of participants achieved 150 minutes per week of leisure-time physical activity. Lack of money (40.3\%) and feeling too tired (38.1\%) were the most frequently reported barriers to physical activity. A dose–response group association was observed between number of perceived barriers and level of physical activity. In the multivariable analysis, lack of time, dislike of exercising, feeling too tired, lack of company, and lack of money were associated with physical inactivity. Conclusion. Detection of the determinants of physical inactivity, a growing epidemic, should be a public health priority. Brazil is a middle-income (developing) country. The prevalence of most of the personal barriers studied was higher in this population than those levels observed in high-income (developed) countries. Perceiving 5 of the 8 barriers investigated was inversely associated with leisure-time physical activity level.},

  abstract = {The gap between the decision to engage in physical activity and subsequent behavioral enactment is considerable for many. Action control theories focus on this discordance in an attempt to improve the translation of intention into behavior. The purpose of this mini-review was to overview one of these approaches, the multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework, which has evolved from a collection of previous works. The main concepts and operational structure of M-PAC was overviewed followed by applications of the framework in physical activity, and concluded with unanswered questions, limitations, and possibilities for future research. In M-PAC, it is suggested that three layered processes (reflective, regulatory, reflexive) build upon each other from the formation of an intention to a sustained profile of physical activity action control. Intention-behavior discordance is because of strategic challenges in goal pursuit (differences in outcome vs. behavioral goals; balancing multiple behavioral goals) and automatic tendencies (approach-avoidance, conservation of energy expenditure). Regulatory processes (prospective and reactive tactics) are employed to hold the relationship between reflective processes and behavior concordant by countering these strategic challenges and automatic tendencies until the development of reflexive processes (habit, identity) begin to co-determine action control. Results from 29 observational and preliminary experimental studies generally support the proposed M-PAC framework. Future research is needed to explore the temporal dynamic between reflexive and regulatory constructs, and implement M-PAC interventions in different forms (e.g., mobile health), and at different levels of scale (clinical, group, population).},

Results showed that message strategies affected state reactance differently across levels of trait reactance. In particular, for those high in trait reactance, inoculation uniquely reduced perceived threat to freedom, which indirectly increased safe-sex intention via state reactance and attitude toward the health behavior. These results demonstrate the importance of using trait reactance as an audience segmentation variable.},

Methods. STEPS is a WHO-developed, standardized but flexible framework for countries to monitor the main NCD risk factors through questionnaire assessment and physical and biochemical measurements. It is coordinated by national authorities of the implementing country. The STEPS surveys are generally household-based and interviewer-administered, with scientifically selected samples of around 5000 participants. Results. To date, 122 countries across all 6 WHO regions have completed data collection for STEPS or STEPS-aligned surveys. Conclusions. STEPS data are being used to inform NCD policies and track risk-factor trends. Future priorities include strengthening these linkages from data to action on NCDs at the country level, and continuing to develop STEPS’ capacities to enable a regular and continuous cycle of risk-factor surveillance worldwide.},

In addition, we review recent findings suggesting that unhappy marriages are associated with morbidity and mortality. We then turn to studies of marital interaction that include assessment of physiological pathways through which marital functioning influences health: the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems. Across these studies, negative and hostile behaviors during marital conflict discussions are related to elevations in cardiovascular activity, alterations in hormones related to stress, and dysregulation of immune function. Using recent conceptualizations of the physiological impact of chronic stress, we illustrate how physiological changes associated with marital functioning in these studies have long-term implications for health outcomes. Finally, we discuss future implications of current research for understanding the relationships among marital functioning, physiology, and health.},

Control and support may have incompatible effects, with efforts by a family member or friend to influence a focal person's behavior undermining the sense of support in the relationship. We examined the implications of control, support, and companionship for the perceived quality of older adults’family relationships and friendships in a sample of 180 older adults. Analyses indicated that the participants’family members and friends were differentially involved in performing control, support, and companionship functions. In addition, perceived relationship quality appeared to be anchored in somewhat different functions for family members versus friends. The perceived quality of family ties was related to emotional support, companionship, and social control, whereas the perceived quality of ties with friends was related to emotional support, instrumental support, and companionship. Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence that social control detracted from perceived relationship quality or that social control interacted with social support in predicting relationship quality. The results help to extend existing knowledge of relationship specialization in later adulthood, and they underscore the usefulness of distinguishing social control, social support, and companionship.},

Five studies contrasted the roles of com- panionship and social support in buffering the effects of life stress, in influencing feelings of loneli- ness and social satisfaction, and in affecting others'judgments. Study 1analyzed data from a commu- nity survey and found that companionship had a main effect on psychological well-being and a buffering effect on minor life stress, whereas social support had only a buffering effect on major life stress. Studies 2, 3, and 4 analyzed data from two college student samples and a different community survey to evaluate how companionship and social support contributed to relationship satisfaction and feelings of loneliness. The results of these studies indicated that companionship was the strongest predictor of these dimensions of social satisfaction. Study 5 used an experimental design to test the hypothesis that a deficit of companionship elicits more negative reactions from others than does a deficit of social support. This hypothesis received partial support. Considered together, the resultsof these studies suggest that companionship plays a more important and more varied role in sustaining emotional well-being than previous studies have acknowledged},

  abstract = {Spouses often monitor and seek to alter each other’s health behavior, but such social control attempts can provoke behavioral resistance and emotional distress. Expectations regarding spouses’ roles in their partners’ health may influence reactions to spousal social control, with resistance and hostility less likely to occur among people who believe spouses should be involved in their partners’ health. Evidence consistent with this idea emerged in a study of 191 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with greater expectations for spousal involvement (particularly females) generally reacted less negatively to spousal control. The findings help to clarify when people with a chronic illness are likely to resist and resent, rather than appreciate, spousal control.},

  abstract = {Psychological reactance theory (PRT; Brehm, 1966) posits that when something threatens or eliminates people’s freedom of behavior, they experience psychological reactance, a motivational state that drives freedom restoration. Complementing recent, discipline-specific reviews (e.g., Quick, Shen, \& Dillard, 2013; Steindl, Jonas, Sittenthaler, Traut-Mattausch, \& Greenberg, 2015), the current analysis integrates PRT research across fields in which it has flourished: social psychology and clinical psychology, as well as communication research. Moreover, the current review offers a rare synthesis of existing reactance measures. We outline five overlapping waves in the PRT literature: Wave 1: Theory proposal and testing, Wave 2: Contributions from clinical psychology, Wave 3: Contributions from communication research, Wave 4: Measurement of reactance, and Wave 5: Return to motivation. As part of our description of Wave 5, we detail scholars’ renewed focus on motivational aspects of the framework, and the ways in which this return to PRT’s motivational roots is allowing researchers to push its accuracy and applicability forward. We use this research that is already occurring in Wave 5 to outline three specific ways in which scholars can direct the continued application of motivation science to the advancement of PRT. Finally, as we outline in a future directions sections for each Wave, assimilating this research illustrates the ways in which an emphasis on motivation can expand and explain PRT research in communication, clinical psychology, and measurement.},

  abstract = {Background:Alcohol consumption has important health-related consequences and numerous biological and social determinants.Objective:To explore quantitatively whether alcohol consumption behavior spreads from person to person in a large social network of friends, coworkers, siblings, spouses, and neighbors, followed for 32 years.Design:Longitudinal network cohort study.Setting:The Framingham Heart Study.Participants:12~067 persons assessed at several time points between 1971 and 2003.Measurements:Self-reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks per week on average over the past year and number of days drinking within the past week) and social network ties, measured at each time point.Results:Clusters of drinkers and abstainers were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to 3 degrees of separation. These clusters were not only due to selective formation of social ties among drinkers but also seem to reflect interpersonal influence. Changes in the alcohol consumption behavior of a person's social network had a statistically significant effect on that person's subsequent alcohol consumption behavior. The behaviors of immediate neighbors and coworkers were not significantly associated with a person's drinking behavior, but the behavior of relatives and friends was.Limitations:A nonclinical measure of alcohol consumption was used. Also, it is unclear whether the effects on long-term health are positive or negative, because alcohol has been shown to be both harmful and protective. Finally, not all network ties were observed.Conclusion:Network phenomena seem to influence alcohol consumption behavior. This has implications for clinical and public health interventions and further supports group-level interventions to reduce problematic drinking.Primary Funding Source:National Institutes of Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The Framingham Heart Study is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.},

Successful behavior change requires that people are not only motivated and capable of initiating a change in their behavior, but also able to sustain that change over time. In this chapter, we examine the psychological processes that guide the decisions people make as they work to change their behavior, with a particular focus on health behavior change. Our review is guided by the thesis that the factors that underlie people's decision to initiate a change in behavior are distinct from those that underlie their decision to maintain that pattern of behavior over time. Specifically, we propose that once people have chosen to initiate a new pattern of behavior, four distinct phases in the behavior change process can be identified (i.e., initial response, continued response, maintenance, and habit) and, moreover, that the primary determinants of people's behavior shift as people transition from one phase to the next. The implications of this perspective for theory and practice in self-regulation and behavior change are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

This paper discusses six challenges or “brakes” that have slowed progress.                                         Purpose/Methods/Results               We engage with six issues that limit investigators’ ability to delineate and test the strategy–target and target–behavior relations that underlie effective interventions according to the experimental medicine approach. We discuss the need for guidance on how to identify the relevant mechanism of action (target) in an intervention and whether a periodic table of health behavior constructs might aid investigators. Experimental and correlational analyses (prospective surveys and behavior change techniques) have been used to test the validity of targets, and we present evidence that there is little agreement among the findings from different research designs. Whereas target engagement is typically analyzed in terms of increasing scores on constructs that impel behavior change, we discuss the role of impeding targets and the benefits of adopting a broader construal of potential targets and approaches to engagement. There is presently a paucity of competitive tests regarding which strategies best engage targets and we discuss empirical criteria and conceptual developments that could enhance the evidence base. Finally, we highlight the need to take “context” or conditional intervention effects more seriously by leveraging the interplay between questions about why interventions work and questions about when and for whom they work.                                         Conclusion               Candid appraisal of the challenges facing research on health behavior change can generate new opportunities for theoretical development and offer direction and cumulative impetus for empirical work.},

The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs the necessary calculations.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness—which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.

Social support has been granted an extraordinary amount  of explanatory power and precision, but to be optimally useful it needs  to be considered in the context of the complexities of social life. In this  chapter, we explore how, by taking a more inclusive view of the aspects  of human interaction, we may be able to refine our understanding not  only of social support, but also of how personal relationships impact on  health and well-being. We also explore how relationship satisfaction and  maintenance may be related to these categories of relationship behavior  as well as serving as potential mediators between relationship behaviors  and health outcomes.},

  abstract = {The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, \& Tellegen, 1988) is one of the most widely used affect scales. Nevertheless, the relation between its two scales, positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), is still controversial. Previous results that suggest independence between NA and PA were limited to manifest variables. In this study, the relation between PA and NA for both state and trait instructions was analyzed by means of structural equation modeling. Two hundred ninety-two participants responded to the PANAS at three occasions of measurement. No association was found between trait PA and NA, but significant negative correlations between state PA and NA emerged. In the second step, the observed variance of state PA and NA was decomposed into a dispositional component, an occasion-specific component, a method-specific component, and a component due to measurement error by employing a multi-construct latent state–trait model. This analysis confirmed and extended the results of our first analysis: the dispositional components of state PA and NA were unrelated. In contrast, the situation-specific components were negatively associated. Thus, the negative correlation between state PA and NA could be traced back to situation-specific effects.},

  abstract = {Objectives               Health‐behaviour change is not predicted well by behavioural intentions alone. Action planning and coping planning are two self‐regulatory strategies that may help bridge the gap between intentions and behaviour. Action planning comprises the when, where and how of implementing a behaviour. Coping planning involves the anticipation of barriers and ways to overcome them. The study examines whether the inclusion of these two planning constructs would improve the overall prediction of physical activity. The main research question is which kind of planning would be beneficial for the initiation of behaviour and which one for its maintenance. Moreover, it is examined whether intentions moderate the planning–behaviour relationship.                                         Methods               A 5‐week longitudinal on‐line study was conducted with 354 participants. Differences in prediction patterns between formerly active and formerly inactive individuals were compared using multigroup structural equation modelling. Moderating effects of intentions were tested by means of latent interactions.                                         Results               Inclusion of the two planning factors accounted for substantially more behaviour variance than intention alone did. Coping planning mediated the intention–behaviour relationship only in formerly active, but not in formerly inactive participants. Moreover, intentions moderated the effects of both types of planning on behaviour.                                         Conclusions               Action planning appears to predict behaviour only when intentions are high. For actors, coping planning represents a critical self‐regulation strategy to maintain their physical activity levels.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Positive and negative forms of social control are commonly used to regulate another person’s health-related behaviors, especially in couples. Social control efforts have been shown to result in desirable, but also undesirable effects on different outcomes. Little is known for which outcomes, when, and under which contextual conditions these different effects unfold in people’s everyday lives. Using the dual-effects model of health-related social control, we predicted that same-day and previous-day positive social control would result in desirable effects on target behavior, and same-day positive control on affect. Same-day and previous-day negative control was assumed to result in undesirable effects on reactant responses (i.e., doing the opposite of what the partner wanted and hiding the unhealthy behavior), and same-day negative control on affect. Further, we explored whether it makes a difference if one or both partners intend to change their health behavior. Three daily diary studies addressed these questions for smoking (Studies 1 and 2), and physical activity (Study 3). Receiving more positive control related to more desirable target behavior, and feeling better; more negative control was associated with more reactant responses and feeling worse. Social control unfolded its effects within 1 day, but hardly across days, indicating that control and its reactions to it are fast-acting processes in daily life. The pattern of results were the same for couples with one and both partners intending to change their behavior. Further, results replicated when using partner-reported provided control. Based on these results, social control cannot be unanimously recommended as a behavior change strategy in couples. Future studies should follow up on dyadic and temporal dynamics of social control in couples’ everyday lives in different contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Too few theories in health psychology address temporal matters in the specified psychological phenomena, their relationships, and the explanation for these relationships. This might lead to underestimating existing relationships between constructs over time or missing out on opportunities for advancing our knowledge with regard to dynamic developments of the phenomena of interest. Examples of existing theories and approaches addressing temporal matters in health psychology are provided. Further, drawing from other disciplines, examples of methodological and conceptual approaches are outlined that offer directions on how to optimize our theories with regard to temporal matters. This might start with including time-related theoretical considerations to the definition of psychological concepts already in cross-sectional research and might reach as far as developing dynamic theories for capturing and changing phenomena of interest in real life. Challenges and opportunities of theorizing about temporal matters in health psychology are addressed.},

This study adopts an innovative perspective by analysing associations across 11 occasions, which allows examining patterns of associations both on the between‐ and within‐person levels.                                         Method               Thirty initially untrained participants of a running training programme completed 11 monthly questionnaires. All questionnaires assessed motivational and volitional variables and self‐reported running. Additionally, net running time of marathon, or half‐marathon distance at the end of programme, was available.                                         Results               Self‐efficacy turned out to be associated with intentions on the between‐ and within‐person levels. Individual differences in change patterns and within‐person fluctuations in volitional variables, intentions, and self‐efficacy turned out to be consistently associated with change patterns and within‐person fluctuations in self‐regulated running training over time and with successfully running marathon or half‐marathon distance.                                         Conclusions               In contrast to examining only one facet of change, this study is the first to differentiate two components of change in health behaviour self‐regulation: a systematic trend component, and a component representing within‐person unsystematic fluctuations. Thus, results of the present study provide a comprehensive picture of the dynamic relations between motivational, volitional, and behavioural characteristics which occur between and within persons.},

Typically, these hypotheses have been investigated by using difference scores or other profile similarity indices as predictors of the outcome variables. These approaches, however, have been vigorously criticized for their conceptual and statistical shortcomings. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is based on polynomial regression and addresses most of these shortcomings: dyadic response surface analysis. This model is tailored for similarity effect hypotheses and fully accounts for the dyadic nature of relationship data. Furthermore, we provide a tutorial with an illustrative example and reproducible R and Mplus scripts that should assist substantive researchers in precisely formulating, testing, and interpreting their dyadic similarity effect hypotheses. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

The common objections are due to a possible misinterpretation of the word complete in the descriptor of health as ‘complete physical, mental and social well-being’. Complete here does not necessarily refer to perfect well-being but can alternatively mean exhaustive well-being, that is, containing all its constitutive features. In line with the alternative reading, I argue that the WHO definition puts forward a holistic account, not a notion of perfect health. I use historical and analytical evidence to defend this interpretation. In the second part of the paper, I further investigate the two different notions of health (holistic health and perfect health). I argue that both ideas are relevant but that the holistic interpretation is more adept for political aims.},

Die vorliegende Untersuchung beruht auf einer Stichprobe von 457 Krebspatienten, die mehrmals vor und nach einer Operation befragt wurden. In dieser Studie erwiesen sich die Skalen als psychometrisch befriedigend. Zahlreiche Hinweise auf die Validität konnten ermittelt werden.

  abstract = {Background               Tobacco smoking is one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real time. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of an app that encourages individuals to quit smoking with the help of a social network member (buddy) in daily life.                                         Objective               The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of the SmokeFree buddy app compared with a control group with self-reported smoking abstinence and carbon monoxide (CO)–verified smoking abstinence as primary outcomes and self-reports of smoked cigarettes per day (CPD) as a secondary outcome.                                         Methods               A total of 162 adults who smoked participated in this single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Around a self-set quit date (ie, 7 days before the self-set quit date and 20 days after) and 6 months later, participants of the intervention and control groups reported on daily smoking abstinence and CPD in end-of-day diaries. Daily smoking abstinence was verified via daily exhaled CO assessments. This assessment was administered via an app displaying results of exhaled CO, thus addressing self-monitoring in both groups. In addition, participants in the intervention group used the SmokeFree buddy app, a multicomponent app that facilitates social support from a buddy of choice.                                         Results               A significant reduction in CPD from baseline to the 6-month follow-up was observed among participants in both groups. Multilevel analyses revealed no significant intervention effect on self-reported and CO-verified daily smoking abstinence at the quit date and 3 weeks later. However, CPD was lower at the quit date and 3 weeks later in the intervention group than in the control group. No significant differences between groups were found for any outcome measures 6 months after the quit date. Overall, low app engagement and low perceived usefulness were observed.                                         Conclusions               Despite some encouraging short-term findings on the amount of smoking, the SmokeFree buddy app did not have beneficial effects on smoking abstinence over and above the self-monitoring control condition. Future studies should examine whether and what support processes can be effectively stimulated and how app use can be improved to better achieve this goal.

  abstract = {This article reports four longitudinal field studies and one experimental study designed to shed light on the functional roles of social support within the stress and coping context. First, the enabling hypothesis is examined that assumes a facilitating effect of support on self‐efficacy, which, in turn, promotes coping with the aftermath of cardiac surgery. Second, we discuss the support cultivation hypothesis that regards support as a mediator between self‐efficacy and various outcomes, such as depressive mood, as illustrated by a finding on the experience of macrosocial stress during the East German transition. Third, support is highlighted as a coping resource by specifying provided partner support as a predictor of patients' coping with cancer. It was found that the direct effect of provided support on coping needs to be mediated by received support in order to become effective. Fourth, coping efforts of a target person are found to be predictive of support intentions of a potential provider. The better a victim appears to cope with various stigmas, the higher the likelihood that a significant other is willing to help. Fifth, in a dyadic study on coping with cancer, partners were found to provide high levels of support to patients, but received support was affected only at later points in time. Time‐lagged partner effects may characterize resource transfer in asymmetric social situations in which only one element of the dyad is under severe stress.           ,              Cet article fait état de quatre études longitudinales sur le terrain et une étude expérimentale qui avaient pour but de clarifier les rôles fonctionnels du soutien social au sein du contexte du stress et de l'adaptation. Premièrement, nous avons examiné l'hypothèse d'habilitation qui assume un effet facilitateur du soutien sur l'auto‐efficacité. Celle‐ci, en retour, promouvoit l'adaptation des patients en postopératoire de chirurgie cardiaque. Deuxièmement, nous discutons l'hypothèse d'une culture de soutien selon laquelle le soutien serait un médiateur entre l'auto‐efficacité et les divers résultats, comme l'humeur dépressive, telle qu'illustrée par un résultat concernant l'expérience de stress macrosocial pendant la transition de l'Allemagne de l'Est. Troisièmement, le soutien est souligné comme une ressource d'adaptation en spécifiant le soutien donné par le conjoint comme prédicteur de l'adaptation des patients au cancer. Les résultats indiquent que l'effet direct du soutien donné sur l'adaptation a besoin d'être médié par le soutien reçu pour devenir efficace. Quatrièmement, on a trouvé que les efforts d'adaptation d'une personne‐cible prédisent les intentions de soutien d'un donneur potentiel. Le mieux la victime paraît s'adapter aux divers stigmas, plus grande est la probabilité qu'une personne significative est disposée à l'aider. Cinquièmement, dans une étude dyadique sur l'adaptation au cancer, on a trouvé que les conjoints offrent des niveaux élevés de soutien aux patients mais le soutien reçu était affecté seulement à des moments ultérieurs. Les effets à retardement du soutien du conjoint peuvent caractériser le transfert de ressource dans des situations sociales asymétriques dans lesquelles seulement un élément de la dyade est sous stress sévère.           ,              El artículo informa sobre cuatro estudios longitudinales de campo y un estudio experimental diseñados para arrojar luz sobre el rol funcional del apoyo social dentro del contexto de estrés y afrontamiento. Primero, se comprueba la hipótesis que asume el efecto facilitador del apoyo sobre la autoeficacia la cual promueve el afrontamiento de las consecuencias de cirugía cardiaca. Segundo, se discute la hipótesis de cultivación de apoyo que considera a éste como mediador entre autoeficacia y varios resultados como estado de ánimo depresivo tal como se vio en los descubrimientos sobre el estrés macrosocial experimentado durante la transición de Alemania de Este. Tercero, se enfatiza que el apoyo es un recurso para el afrontamiento especificando el apoyo proporcionando por la pareja como un predictor de afrontamiento del cáncer en los pacientes. Se encontró que el efecto directo del apoyo proporcionado en el afrontamiento tiene que ser mediado por el apoyo recibido para que pueda ser efectivo. Cuarto, se encontró que los esfuerzos de afrontamiento del destinatario predicen las intenciones de la persona que podría proporcionarlo. En cuanto mejor esta afrontando la víctima varios estigmas más alta la probabilidad de que una persona significativa quiera ayudar. Quinto, en un estudio de díadas sobre el afrontamiento del cáncer se encontró que las parejas proporcionaban altos niveles de apoyo a los pacientes pero el apoyo recibido se veía afectado sólo más tarde en el tiempo. Los retrasados efectos de pareja pueden ser una característica de un traslado de recursos en las situaciones sociales asimétricas en las cuales sólo un elemento de la díada sufre un estrés severo.},

The second aim is to assist researchers planning to perform sample size estimations by suggesting and elucidating available alternative software, guidelines and references that will serve different scientific purposes.},

The 2-Way SSS concurrently appraises 4 principal dimensions: (a) giving emotional support, (b) giving instrumental support, (c) receiving emotional support, and (d) receiving instrumental support. The completeness of the scale, combined with the generic quality of the items, enhances its utility across a diversity of contexts. Importantly, this scale provides a measurement tool that will enable the comparison of social support research outcomes across studies and populations.},

Across 642 independent tests, forming implementation intentions proved effective for cognitive, affective, and behavioural outcomes (.27 ≤ d ≤ .66). Effect sizes were larger when plans had a contingent (if-then) format, participants were highly motivated to pursue the goal, and plans were rehearsed. We developed a new taxonomy of the cues (e.g., time-and-place, task juncture) and responses (e.g., cognitive procedures, ignore- or inner speech-responses) specified in implementation intentions and tested their efficacy in promoting outcomes. Our review underlines the utility of implementation intentions in helping people regulate their thoughts, feelings, and actions and offers a taxonomy of plan contents that could inspire further tests of implementation intentions.},

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of  subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural  environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and  allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA  studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at  periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging  from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological  sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and  practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique  promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding  light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

Estimate effectiveness of goal setting for nutrition and physical activity behavior change, review the effect of goal-setting characteristics on behavior change, and investigate effectiveness of interventions containing goal setting.                                         Data source.               For this review, a literature search was conducted for the period January 1977 through December 2003 that included a Current Contents, Biosis Previews, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and ERIC search of databases and a reference list search. Key words were goal, goal setting, nutrition, diet, dietary, physical activity, exercise, behavior change, interventions, and fitness.                                         Study inclusion and exclusion criteria.               The search identified 144 studies, of which 28 met inclusion criteria for being published in a peer reviewed journal and using goal setting in an intervention to modify dietary or physical activity behaviors. Excluded from this review were those studies that (1) evaluated goal setting cross-sectionally without an intervention; (2) used goal setting for behavioral disorders, to improve academic achievement, or in sports performance; (3) were reviews.                                         Data extraction and synthesis.               The articles were categorized by target audience and secondarily by research focus. Data extracted included outcome measure, research rating, purpose, sample, sample description, assignment, findings, and goal-setting support.                                         Results.               Thirteen of the 23 adult studies used a goal-setting effectiveness study design and eight produced positive results supporting goal setting. No adolescent or child studies used this design. The results were inconclusive for the studies investigating goal-setting characteristics (n = 7). Four adult and four child intervention evaluation studies showed positive outcomes. No studies reported power calculations, and only 32\% of the studies were rated as fully supporting goal setting.                                         Conclusions.               Goal setting has shown some promise in promoting dietary and physical activity behavior change among adults, but methodological issues still need to be resolved. The literature with adolescents and children is limited, and the authors are not aware of any published studies with this audience investigating the independent effect of goal setting on dietary or physical activity behavior. Although, goal setting is widely used with children and adolescents in nutrition interventions, its effectiveness has yet to be reported.},

  abstract = {This study investigated conditions under which young men responded with reactance to the suggestion to reduce their alcohol consumption. In an experimental study, 84 young men (university students, mean age: 24 years) listened to a recorded telephone call and were asked to imagine that they themselves were the recipients of this call. In this call, either a girlfriend or a male friend suggested that the recipient of the call should reduce his alcohol intake that evening. In one condition, the suggestion was highly restrictive; in the other condition, the suggestion was framed in a nonrestrictive way. Perceived threat, negative thoughts, and feelings of anger after listening to the call were assessed. Further outcome variables were intention and perceived probability of complying with the suggestion. Participants felt more anger after hearing the highly restrictive suggestion and more threatened by the suggestion made by the girlfriend. Interaction effects emerged. Participants reported more negative thoughts and lower intention and perceived probability to comply when a highly restrictive suggestion was made by the girlfriend. The male friend’s highly restrictive suggestion resulted in a perceived probability of complying (54\%) that was similar to the probability of the girlfriend’s nonrestrictive suggestion (55\%). Women’s efforts to reduce their male partners’ alcohol consumption can result in boomerang effects. Male peers might be more effective in motivating other men to behave in a healthier way. These results support recent findings with regard to the potential of peer positive social control.},

In this study we investigated the association between self-perceived social relationships, health-related behaviors, biological maturation, and mental health in adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 1,336 adolescents (605 boys and 731 girls) aged between 10 to 17 years from public schools. Self-perceived social relationships (family, friends, and teachers), feelings of stress and sadness, academic performance, tobacco smoking, alcohol and fat consumption, physical activity, and screen time were evaluated by a questionnaire. Biological maturation was assessed by the peak height velocity. We observed that worse perceived social relationships were associated with tobacco smoking (family and teachers), alcohol drinking (teachers), higher consumption of fat (teachers), greater feelings of stress (family and teachers) and sadness (family and friends), and poor academic achievement (friends and teachers).

  abstract = {Both the close relationship processes and health model and the dyadic health influence model posit that beliefs about the relationship (e.g., relationship satisfaction) and influence strategies (e.g., social control) serve as mediators of health behavior change. The evidence for such mediation is limited.This study investigated two competing hypotheses that arise from these models: (1) perceived use of positive and negative social control (attempts to influence the partner’s behaviors) predict sedentary behavior (SB) indirectly, via relationship satisfaction; or (2) relationship satisfaction predicts SB indirectly, via positive and negative social control.Data from 320 dyads (target persons and their partners, aged 18–90 years), were analyzed using mediation models. SB time was measured with GT3X-BT accelerometers at Time 1 (T1; baseline) and Time 3 (T3; 8 months following baseline). Relationship satisfaction and social control were assessed at T1 and Time 2 (T2; 2 months following baseline).Higher T1 relationship satisfaction among target persons predicted target persons’ reporting of higher T2 negative control from partners, which in turn predicted lower T3 SB time among target persons. Lower T1 relationship satisfaction among partners predicted target persons’ reporting of higher T2 perceived negative control from partners, which predicted lower T3 SB time among target persons. On average, both members of the dyad reported moderate-to-high relationship satisfaction and low-to-moderate negative control.In contrast to very low levels of negative control, its low-to-moderate levels may be related to beneficial behavioral effects (lower SB time) among target persons reporting moderate-to-high relationship satisfaction.},

Repeated measures dyadic analysis showed that men in couples with high average HBV ate less than usual in response to positive partner influence. Also, in such couples, normal weight men engaged in more physical activity when positively influenced by their partners. However, normal weight men in couples with low average HBV engaged in less physical activity when influenced by their partners. Women who valued health less than their partners responded to partner influence by eating healthier.

In the INTERHEART study, we explored the triggering association of acute physical activity and anger or emotional upset with AMI to quantify the importance of these potential triggers in a large, international population.Methods:INTERHEART was a case-control study of first AMI in 52 countries. In this analysis, we included only cases of AMI and used a case-crossover approach to estimate odds ratios for AMI occurring within 1 hour of triggers.Results:Of 12\,461 cases of AMI 13.6\% (n=1650) engaged in physical activity and 14.4\% (n=1752) were angry or emotionally upset in the case period (1 hour before symptom onset). Physical activity in the case period was associated with increased odds of AMI (odds ratio, 2.31; 99\% confidence interval [CI], 1.96–2.72) with a population-attributable risk of 7.7\% (99\% CI, 6.3–8.8). Anger or emotional upset in the case period was associated with an increased odds of AMI (odds ratio, 2.44; 99\% CI, 2.06–2.89) with a population-attributable risk of 8.5\% (99\% CI, 7.0–9.6). There was no effect modification by geographical region, prior cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factor burden, cardiovascular prevention medications, or time of day or day of onset of AMI. Both physical activity and anger or emotional upset in the case period were associated with a further increase in the odds of AMI (odds ratio, 3.05; 99\% CI, 2.29–4.07; P for interaction {$<$}0.001).Conclusions:Physical exertion and anger or emotional upset are triggers associated with first AMI in all regions of the world, in men and women, and in all age groups, with no significant effect modifiers.},

  abstract = {Social support is classically conceptualized as “what you can do” or “what you can offer” to support someone in times of stress. But for some individuals, could less be more when it comes to social support? Empirical research has shown that support receipt can have differential effects. A preference for self-reliance in stressful situations might be one explanation as to why social support is not always beneficial for some individuals.        The current work introduces the phenomenon that some people prefer to be self-reliant in times of stress, i.e., they want to independently deal with the stressor instead of receiving direct supportive acts from a partner or someone else. Across seven studies, within three unique populations, and through low and high stress periods, we aimed to understand individual differences in a preference for self-reliance within close relationships. We discovered that a preference for self-reliance is a common phenomenon from adolescence through adulthood. This preference matters at a daily level across different outcomes and relationships, and is an integral part of daily human interaction affecting support transactions across different support providers. People with certain personality traits may be more likely to prefer self-reliance. The interaction between a preference for self-reliance and social support provision has important implications during critical time periods such as the college application process. Times of acute stress are particularly revealing of links between a preference for self-reliance and support transactions.        Wanting to be self-reliant in stressful situations may be a more common desire than previously thought in the literature on close relationships. Individual differences such as the preference for self-reliance may explain the mixed effects of social support. The addition of preference for self-reliance as an individual difference impacting support transactions expands the field’s current understanding of social support and support provision. We now know that there is a desired form of support beyond the classic conceptualization of social support and, for some, less is in fact more.},

  abstract = {Background               Activities directed at attaining health goals are a major part of the daily lives of those fighting chronic diseases. A proliferating population of patients with chronic diseases are participating in web-based patient communities, wherein they can exchange health information and pursue health goals with others virtually.                                         Objective               In this study, we aimed to understand the effect of participation in social media–enabled web-based patient communities on health goal attainment. In particular, we studied the antecedents of health goal attainment in terms of social support and self-reflection in web-based patient communities.                                         Methods               This data set consists of web-based health management activities of 392 patients across 13 health support groups, that is, groups with medical issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and breast cancer; the data of the activities were collected from a leading web-based patient community. Content analysis was used to code the social interactions among the patients on the web-based platform. Cox regression for survival analysis was used to model the hazard ratio of health goal attainment.                                         Results               Our analysis indicated that emotional support from web-based patient communities can increase patients’ probability of achieving their goals (hazard ratio 1.957, 95\% CI 1.416-2.706; P{$<$}.001) while informational support does not appear to be effective (P=.06). In addition, health-related self-reflection increases the patients’ likelihood of goal attainment through web-based patient communities (hazard ratio 1.937, 95\% CI 1.318-2.848; P{$<$}.001), but leisure-oriented self-reflection reduces this likelihood (hazard ratio 0.588, 95\% CI 0.442-0.784; P{$<$}.001).                                         Conclusions               Social media–enabled web-based platforms assist health goal management via both social interaction and personal discipline. This study extends the understanding of web-based patient communities by investigating the effects of both social and cognitive factors on goal attainment. In particular, our study advocates that health goals relating to chronic conditions can be better managed when patients use the facilities of web-based health communities strategically.},

  abstract = {Background: Smallholder farmers receive educational interventions on safe pesticide handling by governmental agencies, industries, or nongovernmental organizations to reduce exposure risks. However, existing educational interventions have limited effects on changing behaviors. Targeting psychosocial determinants of behavior change in educational interventions through theory- and evidence-based approaches may enhance their effectiveness. Objective: We aim at describing the intervention development and study design of a 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial to assess the effects in improving safe pesticide handling and reducing pesticide exposure of (1) an existing educational intervention and (2) a newly developed SMS text messaging intervention based on the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-regulation (RANAS) behavior change approach. Methods: We enrolled 539 Ugandan smallholder farmers in 12 clusters (subcounties). The clusters, each with 45 farmers, were randomly allocated to one of the three arms: (1) educational intervention, (2) educational intervention+RANAS-based SMS text messages, or (3) control group. The educational intervention comprised a 2-day workshop that targeted multiple aspects of safe pesticide handling, whereas the SMS text messages targeted the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and were based on the RANAS approach. For intervention development in this study, this approach includes identifying psychosocial determinants of PPE use at baseline and selecting behavior change techniques to target them in SMS text messages. The primary outcomes of the study are (1) pesticide knowledge, attitude, and practice scores indicating performance throughout the educational intervention; and (2) frequency of PPE use. Secondary outcomes are the RANAS-based behavioral determinants of PPE use, the frequency of glove use, algorithm-based pesticide exposure intensity scores, and signs and symptoms of pesticide poisoning. The outcomes were assessed in structured interviews before the intervention (baseline) and at the 12-month follow-up. The effect of the interventions among the arms will be analyzed using the intervention arms and baseline measures as predictors and the follow-up measures as outcomes in linear multivariable mixed models including the clusters as random effects. The mediating psychosocial determinants of the interventions will be assessed in multiple mediation models. Results: The study was conducted from 2020 to 2021—baseline interviews were conducted in October 2020, and the educational intervention was delivered in November 2020. The RANAS-based SMS text messages were developed based on the baseline data for relevant behavioral determinants of PPE use and sent between February 2021 and September 2021. Follow-up interviews were conducted in October 2021. Overall, 539 farmers were enrolled in the study at baseline; 8.3\% (45/539) were lost to follow-up by the end of the study. Conclusions: This study will contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness and behavior change mechanisms of educational interventions by using an experimental, cluster-randomized study design to improve pesticide handling among smallholder farmers.

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate daily dietary adherence and diabetes-specific distress among older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a function of spouses’ diet-related support and diet-related control (persuasion and pressure) and whether these daily processes differ among couples who do and do not appraise responsibility for managing T2DM as shared. Methods: End-of-day diaries were completed by 126 couples in which one partner had T2DM (patient) and the other did not (spouse). Using electronic diary methods, each partner independently recorded data for 24 consecutive days (patients recorded their day’s dietary adherence and diabetes-specific distress; spouses recorded their day’s involvement in patients’ dietary management). To assess dietary adherence, patients reported the extent to which they followed dietary recommendations that day with items from the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure. To assess diabetes-specific distress, patients reported the extent to which they worried about diabetes that day using items from the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale. Results: Multilevel modeling revealed that, relative to the prior day, spouses’ diet-related support was associated with increases in patients’ adherence whereas diet-related persuasion and pressure were associated with decreases in adherence; spouses’ pressure was associated with increases in patients’ diabetes-specific distress. When partners appraised responsibility for managing T2DM as shared, support was associated with decreases in diabetes-specific distress; pressure was associated with decreases in adherence. Conclusions: Our findings offer insight into partners’ day-to-day disease-related interactions and identify those that are likely to be beneficial versus detrimental for patients’ physical and psychological health.

Steyer, Schwenkmezger, Notz \&amp; Eid, 1997): Befindlichkeit kennzeichnet das momentane innere Erleben und Empfinden eines Individuums ("erlebnismäßig repräsentiert") und nicht beobachtbares Verhalten. Eine Befindlichkeit ist im Gegensatz zu Gefühlen nicht auf spezifische Objekte (z.B. Personen, Dinge, Ereignisse, Organe) oder Situationen gerichtet und ist nicht an spezifische, erlebnismäßig präsente Ursachen gebunden. Sie lässt sich anhand dieser Kriterien von Einstellungen, Bedürfnissen und Organempfindungen abgrenzen. Im Gegensatz zu Motiven fehlt der Befindlichkeit die Zielgerichtetheit (Intentionalität) und im Vergleich zu Motiven und Persönlichkeitseigenschaften ist die Befindlichkeit durch eine geringere zeitliche Stabilität gekennzeichnet. Die Autoren vertreten ein mehrdimensionales Befindlichkeitskonzept. Sie gehen dabei auf Grundlage vorliegender Befunde sowie eigener exploratorischer und konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalysen (Eid, Notz, Schwenkmezger \&amp; Steyer, 1994) von der Bipolarität der zugrundeliegenden Stimmungsdimensionen aus. Der vorliegende Datensatz aus der Entwicklung des "Mehrdimensionalen Befindlichkeitsfragebogen" (MDBF) umfasst neben den Befindlichkeitsurteilen von 503 Vpn eine Vielzahl weiterer Angaben zu situativen und personalen Bedingungen.

  abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of individual planning, dyadic planning (i.e., joint planning, targeting the behavior of one person only: the target person), and collaborative planning (i.e., joint planning and joint behavioral performance) on sedentary behavior among dyads. Methods: Dyads (N = 320 target persons and their partners, aged 18–90 years) were randomized into three PA planning conditions (individual, dyadic, or collaborative) or an active (education) control condition. Main outcomes, i.e., sedentary time, proportion of time spent in SB and light-intensity PA, proportion of time spent in SB and total PA were measured with GT3X-BT accelerometers at baseline, 1-week follow-up, and 36-week followup. Two-level models with measurement points nested in participants were fit, separately for target persons and partners. Results: Findings for target persons obtained at 1-week follow-up indicated that in the collaborative planning condition SB time significantly decreased, compared to the control condition (p = .013). There was an improvement in the proportion of time spent in SB and light-intensity PA (p = .019), and the proportion of time spent in SB and total PA (p = .018), indicating that SB time was displaced by PA. Effects of individual and dyadic planning were not significant, compared to the control condition. None of interventions had a significant effect on SB indices at 36-week follow-up. Regarding dyadic partners, there were no effects of planning interventions at 1-week follow-up or 36-week follow-up, compared to the control condition. Conclusions: Collaborative planning may prompt a short-term reduction of SB time and result in a shift towards a healthier balance between SB time and PA time among target persons, who did not adhere to PA guidelines at baseline.},

Participants then completed 28 daily meal surveys about their meat consumption. Results Among high-meat eating partners, those higher in openness/intellect and compassion ate less meat. Additionally, higher intellect among low-meat eating partners predicted lower meat consumption among high-meat eating partners. Conclusions These findings replicate evidence that personality plays an important role in meat-eating and extend this evidence to meat consumption in a relational context.},

Our analysis revealed that social relations are beneficial for health behaviors such as chronic illness self-management and decreased suicidal tendency. The salutary effects of general measures of social relations (e.g. being validated, being cared for, etc.) on health behaviors (e.g. healthy diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol abuse) are weaker, but specific measures of social relations targeting corresponding health behaviors are more predictive. There is growing evidence that social relations are predictive of mortality and cardiovascular disease, and social relations play an equally protective role against both the incidence and progression of cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, evidence was mixed for the association between social relations and cancer. We discuss these findings and potential areas for future research such as other dimensions of social relations, support–receiver interactions, and observer ratings of social relations.},

  abstract = {Habitual physical activity reduces coronary heart disease events, but vigorous activity can also acutely and transiently increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible persons. This scientific statement discusses the potential cardiovascular complications of exercise, their pathological substrate, and their incidence and suggests strategies to reduce these complications. Exercise-associated acute cardiac events generally occur in individuals with structural cardiac disease. Hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities are predominantly responsible for cardiac events among young individuals, whereas atherosclerotic disease is primarily responsible for these events in adults. The absolute rate of exercise-related sudden cardiac death varies with the prevalence of disease in the study population. The incidence of both acute myocardial infarction and sudden death is greatest in the habitually least physically active individuals. No strategies have been adequately studied to evaluate their ability to reduce exercise-related acute cardiovascular events. Maintaining physical fitness through regular physical activity may help to reduce events because a disproportionate number of events occur in least physically active subjects performing unaccustomed physical activity. Other strategies, such as screening patients before participation in exercise, excluding high-risk patients from certain activities, promptly evaluating possible prodromal symptoms, training fitness personnel for emergencies, and encouraging patients to avoid high-risk activities, appear prudent but have not been systematically evaluated.}

  abstract = {Interventions promoting physical activity often fail to achieve long term behaviour change (Foster et al., 2005). Most of our activities in daily life are habitual. Thus, features of habits are presumably important in the modification of physical activity habits (Hillsdon, Foster, \&amp; Thorogood, 2005). There is a debate about the definition and operationalisation of habits and a need for further investigations of their meaning for health behaviour in general and for physical activity in particular (Ajzen, 2002; Maddux, 1997; Sniehotta \&amp; Presseau, 2011). This thesis aims to better understand the habit construct and to examine its meaning for physical activity. Therefore the habit construct was based on theory and with regards to content. Habit was defined, important features were elaborated and its meaning in social-cognitive models of health behaviour was discussed. In empirical studies the habit construct was investigated with regard to physical activity. First regression analyses explored whether habit strength predicts physical activity. Second variance analyses examined the differences in habit strength between persons of different stages of change, measured by the TTM (Prochaska \&amp; Velicer, 1997). The Self Report Habit Index (Verplanken \&amp; Orbell, 2003), measuring habit strength, was translated into German (dSRHI) and adapted for the empirical studies at first and validated subsequently. Reliability was assessed by Cronbachs Alpha and test- re-test. Validity was assessed by correlations between habit strength and physical activity as well as habit strength, measured by an alternative method (Wood, Quinn \&amp; Kashy, 2002). For the purpose of this thesis habit is defined as a learned disposition to repeat a behaviour because of certain cues of the situational context. The behaviour is initiated automatically by these cues. A strong habit for physical activity means that it was repeated often and regularly and is initiated automatically. It is controlled by the situational context instead of by intentions. It expresses identity and is stable over time. The results of the studies show that habit is a stable construct and can be measured by habit strength. The dSRHI measures habit strength for physical activity reliable and valid. The items show moderate item difficulty and high item-total correlation. High internal consistency and reasonable re-test-reliability were attested. Principle component analyses confirmed a one-factor structure. Low to moderate associations between the dSRHI and physical activity as well as habit strength measured by context stability and frequency (Wood et al., 2002) confirm the validity of the dSRHI. Regression analyses showed that habit strength of physical activity predicts moderate and vigorous intense physical activity. Variance analyses showed significant differences between habit strength in pre-actional and actional stages and between the stages action and maintenance (Prochaska \&amp; Velicer, 1997). This indicates that habit strength is not a discrete phenomena, but incremental and important for the maintenance of physical activity. The construct of habit is important for evidence based methods and techniques, which should be considered in physical activity interventions and explored in a longitudinal research design. There is a need for further investigations in measuring habit strength: Items of the (d)SRHI concerning automaticity should be investigated conceptually as well as empirically. Furthermore, additional items concerning cues of the situational context should be discussed.},

  abstract = {The expanding domain of digital mental health is transitioning beyond traditional telehealth to incorporate smartphone apps, virtual reality, and generative artificial intelligence, including large language models. While industry setbacks and methodological critiques have highlighted gaps in evidence and challenges in scaling these technologies, emerging solutions rooted in co-design, rigorous evaluation, and implementation science offer promising pathways forward. This paper underscores the dual necessity of advancing the scientific foundations of digital mental health and increasing its real-world applicability through five themes. First, we discuss recent technological advances in digital phenotyping, virtual reality, and generative artificial intelligence. Progress in this latter area, specifically designed to create new outputs such as conversations and images, holds unique potential for the mental health field. Given the spread of smartphone apps, we then evaluate the evidence supporting their utility across various mental health contexts, including well-being, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and substance use disorders. This broad view of the field highlights the need for a new generation of more rigorous, placebo-controlled, and real-world studies. We subsequently explore engagement challenges that hamper all digital mental health tools, and propose solutions, including human support, digital navigators, just-in-time adaptive interventions, and personalized approaches. We then analyze implementation issues, emphasizing clinician engagement, service integration, and scalable delivery models. We finally consider the need to ensure that innovations work for all people and thus can bridge digital health disparities, reviewing the evidence on tailoring digital tools for historically marginalized populations and low- and middle-income countries. Regarding digital mental health innovations as tools to augment and extend care, we conclude that smartphone apps, virtual reality, and large language models can positively impact mental health care if deployed correctly.},

Spouses reported feeling lower self-esteem, less positive affect, and more negative affect in response to their partner’s use of ineffective rather than effective strategies. In addition, both spouses rated their partners’ use of ineffective (compared to effective) strategies as less motivated by a concern for the participant’s welfare and more motivated by their partner’s own desire to exert control within the relationship.},

Despite clear evidence of this influence, relatively little is known about the possible mechanisms by which individuals in densely transactive systems (i.e., relationships with high goal-related interdependence) influence each other's health. I draw on transactive goal dynamics (TGD) theory to highlight potential processes involved in health behavior change in interdependent systems. I introduce and discuss relevant literature about two related constructs—partner-directed goal pursuit and partner-directed goal qualities. I then highlight two areas where drawing on TGD principles may be useful, including unpacking recursive patterns of influence and health behavior change in concordant systems. I conclude with recommendations for future research.},

  abstract = {Close relationships are associated with many positive outcomes throughout life, including improved physical health and well-being. Traditionally, theory and research on the health benefits of close relationships have focused on either the total amount of support perceived available within a person's entire social network or the support provided by romantic partners (Shankar et al. in Psychology and Health, 30(6), 686–698; 2015). Limited work has examined the impact of distinct relationship types, particularly friends. In this article, we address this critical gap in our current knowledge. First, we identify the features of friends and friendship networks that distinguish them from other types of adult relationships, especially romantic relationships. Second, we use the strength and strain model (Slatcher \& Selcuk in Current Directions in Psychological Science, 26(1), 16–21; 2017) as a framework to consider how adult friendships might impact physical health in ways similar to but also distinct from romantic partners. Utilizing this specific model, we identify features of friendships—the size and structure of friendship networks, the norms that define friendships, and the levels of interdependence in friendships—and discuss how each feature can amplify or blunt the strengths and strains afforded by friends, including their impact on health. Finally, we provide a roadmap and identify priorities to advance research on friendships and physical health.},

This study examined the mediating role of adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity on weight loss in a behavioral weight-loss trial testing the use of personal digital assistants (PDA) for self-monitoring. Methods Mediation analysis was conducted to examine the possible mediating role of adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity between treatments using varying self-monitoring methods (paper record, PDA, and PDA with daily tailored feedback messages) and weight loss. Findings The sample (N = 210) was predominantly white (78\%) and female (85\%). Compared to a paper record, using a PDA for self-monitoring diet (P = 0.027) and physical activity (P = 0.014) had significant direct effects on weight loss at 12 months, as well as a significant indirect effect on outcomes through improved adherence to self-monitoring (PS {$<$} 0.001). Receiving an automated daily feedback message via PDA only had a significant indirect effect on weight through self-monitoring adherence to diet (P = 0.004) and physical activity (P = 0.002). Conclusions Adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity is important as the underlying mechanism in this technology-supported behavioral weight-loss intervention.},

We systematically reviewed prospective studies on the association between social isolation, loneliness and mortality outcomes in adults aged 18 years or older, as well as studies on these relationships in individuals with CVD or cancer, and conducted a meta-analysis. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (reg. no. CRD42022299959). A total of 90 prospective cohort studies including 2,205,199 individuals were included. Here we show that, in the general population, both social isolation and loneliness were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (pooled effect size for social isolation, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.26 to 1.39; P\,{$<$}\,0.001; pooled effect size for loneliness, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.20; P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and cancer mortality (pooled effect size for social isolation, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.19 to 1.28; P\,{$<$}\,0.001; pooled effect size for loneliness, 1.09; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.17; P\,=\,0.030). Social isolation also increased the risk of CVD mortality (1.34; 95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.44; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was an increased risk of all-cause mortality in socially isolated individuals with CVD (1.28; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.48; P\,=\,0.001) or breast cancer (1.51; 95\% CI, 1.34 to 1.70; P\,{$<$}\,0.001), and individuals with breast cancer had a higher cancer-specific mortality owing to social isolation (1.33; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.75; P\,=\,0.038). Greater focus on social isolation and loneliness may help improve people’s well-being and mortality risk.},

  abstract = {Background: Prior research demonstrates that state reactance is a function of message characteristics like controlling language and personalities like trait reactance. However, empirical evidence on whether trait reactance moderates the effect of controlling language on state reactance is inconsistent. Aims: The primary goal of this study is to provide a culture-centered explanation on the boundary of how trait reactance moderates the effect of controlling language on state reactance. Method: Two between-subject experiments, which recruited smokers (N = 400) and nonsmokers (N = 431) respectively, were conducted online. They both employed the same 2 (controlling language: high vs. low) × 2 (country: China vs. US) experimental design. Results: In both studies, trait reactance only moderated the effect of controlling language on state reactance in China. Specifically, trait reactance enhanced this effect among Chinese smokers and nonsmokers. Conversely, controlling language elevated the level of state reactance among American smokers, regardless of their trait reactance. Additionally, controlling language was directly related to state reactance only among smokers. The relationship between trait reactance and state reactance was only significant among American nonsmokers. Limitations: This study used a convenience sample and a single issue. Additionally, although the experiment message was adapted from other studies on psychological reactance, future research should pay attention to the possibility of certain confounders. Conclusion: Our investigation suggests that trait reactance may only moderate the impact of controlling language on state reactance in a culture that dismisses the priority of freedom.

We explored the self-regulatory strategies that people use for these three types of self-control conflicts and their subjective efficacy as a function of conflict type. In addition, we hypothesized that people who more frequently create strategy-situation fit by tying strategies to the conflict types they are effective for, are more successful at self-control. A pilot study identified 22 different self-regulatory strategies that could be used for more than one type of self-control conflict. We then used a large data set from two pooled experience sampling datasets (n = 14,067 reported self-control conflicts) to quantify these strategies’ popularity and subjective efficacy in daily life. Eight strategies were positively and three negatively associated with subjective self-regulatory success but subjective efficacy often depended on type of conflict: Some strategies were effective and some maladaptive only for some types of self-control conflicts. Individuals who created strategy-situation fit for some strategies also reported greater self-regulatory success, as hypothesized. We discuss regulatory flexibility as a crucial component of good self-control.},

In the truth and bias model, judgments about the world are pulled by 2 primary forces, the truth force and the bias force, and these 2 forces are interrelated. The truth and bias model differentiates force and value, where the force is the strength of the attraction and the value is the location toward which the judgment is attracted. The model also makes a formal theoretical distinction between bias and moderator variables. Two major classes of biases are discussed: biases that are measured with variables (e.g., assumed similarity) and directional bias, which refers to the extent to which judgments are pulled toward 1 end of the judgment continuum. Moderator variables are conceptualized as variables that affect the accuracy and bias forces but that do not affect judgments directly. We illustrate the model with 4 examples. We discuss the theoretical, empirical, methodological, measurement, and design implications of the model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were prompted six times a day over six days (Study 1) or four times a day over two weeks (Study 2) to report their recent thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Multilevel modeling results indicated that negative and positive affect account for most, but not all, of the within-person variance in personality states. Importantly, situation variables predicted variance in some personality states even after accounting for fluctuations in affect, indicating that fluctuations in personality states may be more than fluctuations in state affect.},

Mittels konkurrierender konfirmatorischer Strukturmodelle wurden auf Basis der Daten einer für Deutschland repräsentativen Normstichprobe von N~=~2~524 Personen 3~theoriebasierte bzw. in der Literatur berichtete Modellvarianten geprüft. Nach Modifikation des Messmodells des psychischen Faktors konnte eine gute Datenpassung des zweidimensionalen Modells erreicht werden (CFI~=~.967, TLI~=~.992, SRMR~=~.037). Der beste Modell-Fit ergab sich jedoch für ein dreidimensionales Modell, das die emotionale Rollenfunktion als vom psychischen Faktor separierte Komponente annimmt (CFI~=~.972, TLI~=~.991, SRMR~=~.035). Beide modifizierten Strukturmodelle erlauben eine psychometrisch gut begründete Auswertung der SF-12-Daten.

Accelerometers (objective) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (self-report) were used to assess PA.                                         Results                                Participants in both experimental conditions reported being satisfied with the intervention and highly committed to their PA plans. Participants were able to follow instructions and completed the intervention in less than 30 minutes. Participants in the collaborative IIs condition reported a greater increase in PA-related social support (partial                 2                 = .185, P {$<$} .05) and self-reported recreational PA (partial                 2                 = .210, P {$<$} .05) at 6 weeks compared to the other 2 conditions. In this pilot study, there were no significant group differences on other psychosocial outcomes or for objective PA; however, time in light PA trended higher for the collaborative IIs condition compared to the other 2 conditions (partial                 2                 = .237, P = .056).                                                        Conclusions               This study provides initial support for collaborative IIs for PA with PWD and their partners. This brief intervention was feasible and highly acceptable, and it may improve relationship dynamics around PA as well as ultimately increase PA.},

  abstract = {It is common for romantic partners to influence one another’s health maintenance behaviors. Previous research has examined positively and negatively framed social control messages to understand health behavior outcomes and relational affect; however, this study confirms and extends previous research by studying the associations between health transformations (from interdependence theory, health behaviors enacted for the partner) and relationship satisfaction. Data from a cross-sectional dyadic survey of heterosexual couples were analyzed using actor–partner independence models. As expected, dyadic results showed that positive social control was associated with greater healthy and fewer unhealthy partner transformations, whereas negative social control was associated with lower relationship satisfaction and more unhealthy transformations. Further, the breadth of partner health behaviors that individuals attempt to influence moderated the associations between social control and relationship satisfaction and health transformations. We discuss how the results from this study underscore the health implications associated with the nature and breadth of social control communication in romantic relationships.},

  abstract = {The aim of the research was to determine, based on a systematic review of published studies that dealt with barriers to physical activity in adolescents, which are the most common barriers that stop adolescents from engaging in physical activity. Within the research original scientific studies are included, the ones that had male and female adolescents as a sample of respondents, studies related to the analysis of barriers that occur in adolescents, in which assessments were made on the basis of a questionnaire related to barriers. The research included studies from January 1, 2003, to July 2020. The final analysis, based on the set criteria, included 11 studies that were processed and presented. Most studies have shown that more internal barriers than external ones occur in girls comparing to boys, while external barriers are more common causes of not engaging in physical activity in boys. The three most common barriers among boys were: lack of company, lack of time and school obligations. Among girls, the most commonly reported barrier was "I'd rather do some other activities" and reporting a lack of time. The significance of this research is that it provides information on barriers in respondents who are adolescents, ie the reasons why their physical activity is reduced or they do not engage in physical activity at all.

  abstract = {To evaluate a theory-guided intervention on oral self-care and examine the possible mechanisms among self-regulatory factors, two brief intervention arms were compared, an information-based education treatment and a self-regulation treatment focusing on planning and action control. Young adults (N = 284; aged 18-29 years) were assessed at baseline and 1 month later. The self-regulation intervention improved levels of oral self-care, dental planning and action control. Moreover, a moderated mediation model with planning as the mediator between experimental conditions and dental outcome, and self-efficacy as well as action control as moderators elucidated the mechanism of change. More self-efficacious participants in the self-regulation condition benefitted in terms of more planning, and those who monitored their actions yielded higher levels of oral hygiene. Dental self-efficacy, dental planning and action control are involved in the improvement of oral self-care. Their joint consideration may contribute to a better understanding of health behavior change. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

  abstract = {Background               With the development of emerging technologies, digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) help to maintain regular physical activity in daily life.                                         Objective               To comprehensively understand the design implementations of habit formation techniques in current DBCIs, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the implementations of behavior change techniques, types of habit formation techniques, and design strategies in current DBCIs.                                         Methods               The process of this review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 4 databases were systematically searched from 2012 to 2022, which included Web of Science, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that used digital tools for physical activity, examined behavior change intervention techniques, and were written in English.                                         Results               A total of 41 identified research articles were included in this review. The results show that the most applied behavior change techniques were the self-monitoring of behavior, goal setting, and prompts and cues. Moreover, habit formation techniques were identified and developed based on intentions, cues, and positive reinforcement. Commonly used methods included automatic monitoring, descriptive feedback, general guidelines, self-set goals, time-based cues, and virtual rewards.                                         Conclusions               A total of 32 commonly design strategies of habit formation techniques were summarized and mapped to the proposed conceptual framework, which was categorized into target-mediated (generalization and personalization) and technology-mediated interactions (explicitness and implicitness). Most of the existing studies use the explicit interaction, aligning with the personalized habit formation techniques in the design strategies of DBCIs. However, implicit interaction design strategies are lacking in the reviewed studies. The proposed conceptual framework and potential solutions can serve as guidelines for designing strategies aimed at habit formation within DBCIs.},
