Statistical estimation for three different processes that bring about non-independence are presented. In each, a variable X influences Y. First, the X variable of one person may influence the Y variable of his or her partner. Second, the Y variables of the two people may directly influence each other. Third, the two X and Y scores may be indicators of couple-level factors.},

  abstract = {Analyzing over-time dyadic data can be challenging, particularly when using multilevel models with complex random-effect structures. In this tutorial, we discuss the best practices of model specification for longitudinal dyadic multilevel modeling, providing a practical guide to specifying (and respecifying) random effects with both theoretical and practical considerations in mind. We begin by defining random effects in the context of repeated-measures dyadic data and address common issues such as nonconvergence. Then, using two models—the dyadic growth-curve and the stability and influence model—we demonstrate how to apply these guidelines in both SAS and R. The dyadic growth-curve model provides a straightforward example, whereas the stability and influence model illustrates common challenges when dealing with complex random-effect structures and convergence issues. In the first exercise, we explain how to customize the variance-covariance matrix for these analyses in SAS. In the second exercise, we adapt these analyses for R and discuss how to implement the sum-and-difference approach for indistinguishable dyads. We conclude with a discussion of alternative models and go over the utility of data simulation during study design, helping readers plan and select the best approach for their research.},

  abstract = {Companionship is related to better affect and relationship satisfaction, but few studies have examined both partners' perspectives over time and the link between companionship and health. In three intensive longitudinal studies (Study 1: 57 community couples; Study 2: 99 smoker–nonsmoker couples; Study 3: 83 dual-smoker couples), both partners reported daily companionship, affect, relationship satisfaction, and a health behavior (smoking in Studies 2 and 3). We proposed a dyadic score model that focuses on the couple level for companionship as a dyadic predictor with considerable shared variance. On days with higher companionship, couples reported better affect and relationship satisfaction. When partners differed in companionship, they also differed in affect and relationship satisfaction. For smoking, a different picture emerged: Whereas smokers with nonsmoking partners smoked less on average with higher companionship, smokers with smoking partners smoked more on days with higher companionship. Findings show companionship as a consequential relationship construct deserving further study. Using the dyadic score model acknowledged both partners' perspectives on companionship. It demonstrated higher precision for detecting effects of partner averages in a dyadic predictor compared with traditional approaches, tests for effects of partner differences in a dyadic predictor and in outcome while maintaining the focus on the dyad.},
